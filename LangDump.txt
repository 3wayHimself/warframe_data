Ties That Bind
------
Tenno,

It seems I am again in a bit of trouble. Wait, before you go jumping to conclusions, I swear, this time it is not my fault. I used to belong to this organization, the problem is this organization has refused to accept my resignation. I guess certain people cannot live without my skills. This is understandable as I am very good at what I do. I just prefer to work without a plasma turret pointed at my head. I am sure you understand.

Now, I know what you are thinking. The last time you helped me you got a little more than you bargained for. Things worked out in the end though, right? Help me again and I will make it worth your while. Trust me.

Directive

Do you hear that my Tenno? The silence of tyrants who fell by your blade? Your sacrifice is complete and you should rest. The cryo-chamber will wipe away the unpleasantness of what has passed. When you are called to wake, it must be because the system is once again out of balance. Perform your duties then, as you have now. 

Until we meet again,
Lotus

THE TOMB

Picked up a big Rubedo ore deposit on scan today. Risked the fuel and touched down on an abandoned Eco Orbiter. Couldn't believe what we found - an Orokin Chamber in the ice! Thousand years old? Salvage like this is worth more than water, but Dad said we weren't going to touch a thing. Made me swear to forget we ever saw it.

They say these chambers are just tombs for 'Tenno'. Just dead soldiers from the war before. Buried in their Warframe armor. When I pushed my face against the glass I felt something. I didn't say anything to Dad though, Tenno are just magic and fantasy. False hope.

Things are getting desperate with the Grineer army now. If I had one wish, it'd be that the Tenno were real. For my part, I'm going to make sure the Grineer never find this place. I wiped the coordinates from the log - we'll have to look elsewhere for Rubedo.

Dad and I picked up a big Rubedo ore deposit on scan today so we risked the fuel and touched down on an abandoned Orbiter. I couldn't believe what we found - an old Orokin Chamber in the ice! Dad was angry, that the salvage was probably worth ten thousand credits but we weren't going to touch a thing. He made me swear not to tell anyone about what we saw.

My Dad said these Chambers are just tombs for the ancient Tenno soldiers but when I pushed my face up to the cryo's glass I felt something. Some people think they'll come back one day, but Dad said that was delusional. Tenno are just magic and fantasy to him. It made him sad to say that though. With the Grineer army uniting the colonies by force Dad says the only light left in his life is me. He's such a sap!

After what I saw today, count me in with the delusional ones! I think the Tenno are real, alive and I'm going to keep their secret. I wiped the salvage coordinates for the log - we'll have to look elsewhere for Rubedo.

The Prototype

It works! They said it could not be done, that the Void salvage was only good for a museum! 

Now we have functional prototype of Orokin energy beams installed in our Robotics! While I am horribly burned and limbless it was worth it in the service of our great enterprise!

Due to the valuable nature of these Robotics I have added a secondary defense system that triggers when the Moa is critically damaged.

Survivor account: Rodin Freighter 

They struck during the night cycle. I woke to hear the massive thunder of one of their anchor mines tearing into our hull, then screaming. They tore through our security like they weren't there. Every one of them as big as the biggest man I've ever seen.  I never seen anything like it.

Those of us who survived the initial strike were captured and taken to the loading bay. We thought maybe they'll hold us here for ransom. We were so naive. That's when he came in. They said his name was Captain Vor, he was even bigger than the others and even they seemed to fear him. For reasons I will never know, he picked me out of the crowd. I was taken to the command room and told to watch. I wasn't prepared for what came next.

They just opened the external bay doors. Everyone single one of those people, hundreds of men, women and children disappeared in an instant. Sucked out into nothingness. Then, just as quickly, they took placed me in an escape pod. As they closed the door, Vor looked me right in the eye and said "The message you will deliver to Earth's colonies is one simple word: 'SUBMIT'"

The Grineer are nothing but junk raiders. How is it possible that they were able to overtake an entire freighter convoy. I've dealt with these Grineer before. Little more than scavengers, subsisting off the space junk that happens to float by their decrepit colonies. They do not have the soldiers or the ships to take out a freighter like the Rodin. At most they've been able to pull off small raids on broken down merchant vessels. No, this was not the work of the Grineer. Which one of those treacherous outer colonies has conspired against us this time?
I need answers as soon as possible. The upcoming trade mission to the Martian colonies must go smoothly.

Gript Seev ,

Disposal of the Unfit has become tiresome. The less damaged ones can be used to soften a ship before a full raid but the truly unfit are good for little more than target practice. We can no longer afford to waste protein on these mistakes and we need more soldiers to fill our new ships.
I am sending you new analysis on Orokin cloning techniques. I expect to see better results from you than last time. You are not the only Grower in the Grineer army.

General Sargus Ruk
------
736.012

General Ruk,

We have captured the Rodin. Resistance was pathetic and we made an example of those too weak to die in battle. The strongest specimens have been taken to the lab for inclusion in our gene pool. With this new freighter thousands more troops can now be carried into battle and the colonies around earth are one step closer to submission.

Captain Vor
------
736.020

My Queens,

The strike on the trade convoy was a success. Our fleet has increased two fold. Our cloning facilities are growing soldiers faster than ever before. These ships will carry those soldiers into battle.
Earth's colonies grow weak as we grow strong. Our power is surging. Where will you have us strike first?

General Sargas Ruk
------
The Grineer are the most dangerous threat in an Age, and the reason for your awakening.. Details are scarce on their origin, but they seemingly emerged from out of nowhere and started a campaign of domination. Ruled by a mysterious pair of Twin Queens who respond to any threat with absolute force, they have completely swallowed existing colonies and threaten many others.  Where did they come from? What is the source of their power? These are questions you need to answer Tenno.
------
The Corpus is a Merchant Cult, built on the foundation of salvaged technology and Robotics. 

They scavenge the outer systems, greedy for the Old War salvage. Their most sought after of all - the Tenno and their WARFRAME armor.

Those captured are treated as salvage; meticulously dissected, integrated. The remains are sold to the highest bidder.
------
INFESTATION describes both a disease and its victims - a metamorphic affliction without cure. Living organisms are consumed and merged into rabid amalgamations.

Individuals are violent and animalistic yet the larger whole exhibits signs of coordination, with multiple swarms converging on ships and colonies.

Its origins are uncertain but there is historical evidence of a similar outbreak before The Collapse.
------
From the chaos of the Collapse, they emerged. Violent hordes of decaying clones, overflowing from their toxic womb. They flood the Origin System, swallowing colonies whole.

The twin Queens, the SISTERS, have devised a plan to transform the scattered colonies into an Empire across the planets.

The Sisters have sent their most trusted brood on a vital quest - the TENNO, hidden and asleep, must never awake.
------
MY QUEENS -

You were right, the Tenno threat is real. We found one drifting near Pluto but the Lotus knew we were coming. She purged the Cryo moments before we had them and sent a squad of Tenno to break our assault.

They escaped. We are working on tracing them. Separate this Tenno from the flock and it should be easy to kill. We shattered its Warframe and expect such an abrupt Cryo purge will have damaged its memories.

We anxiously await punishment for failing this task.

We've decoded a segment - we are zeroing in on the Grineer Settlement. The Corpus are anxious to preserve their contract with the Grineer - they have dispatched new tools to the next segment of Capture targets...
------
ARID FEAR
------
RE: Secret Grineer Colony.

How do we hide it? The Tenno, with their eyeless slag, will squeeze it from our Scouts! They already know our methods from their Capture missions. Data-viruses distributed among our flock will not hold them off. Hiding the Grineer base and collecting our fees requires escalation.

My plan is simple. Gather our Scouts and Navigators and launch them in to the Void. This has two benefits: the Betrayers will be hard-pressed to assemble the coordinate data and if they do, they will place themselves at great risk aboard a conventional craft within the Void's storm.

If the board approves I will divide our flock into three groups and begin. It pains me to help the Dogs in this way, but as always, profit numbs the feeling.

Alad V
------
MY QUEENS -

They found us. Why did the Corpus think they could hide in the Void? Despite their heritage they seem blind to the Tenno's connection to that place. I know you are sour on mysticism but I'm beginning to turn my view on it.

Every time we tear a Tenno corpse from its metal womb we find nothing to explain their power. Our Warframe engineers gesture wildly about nanotechnology, how reactive dissolution hides the answers. What if a Warframe is merely a lightning rod? A conduit for these demons of the Void? Consider how it could change our plan.

For now I await the Tenno's invasion of our Settlements. I have brought with me some reinforcements and your messages of encouragement to rile up the troops.

VOR

SLING-STONE
------
We have just learned that the Grineer Empire is preparing a major offensive against the Corpus. The Sisters have grown impatient with the Corpus monopoly on manufacturing supplies. Their aim is to destroy resource stockpiles throughout Corpus space in order to force the arrogant Corpus back to the bargaining table. The Grineer are deploying new FOMORIAN class ships, poised to strike the Corpus within days.

As much as we'd like to see the Corpus suffer we cannot allow such a growth in Grineer influence to go unchecked. We must work together to destroy the Fomorian ships as they appear or we will suffer resource shortages that will curtail our war effort. We must uphold the balance of this conflict.

Tenno, you must coordinate your attacks - their engineers will be repairing these ships throughout our assault. This is not a standard sabotage mission. You will need to inject a chemical agent harvested from the Infestation to destabilize the Fomorian reactors. With enough corruption the Fomorian reactors will implode and take the monstrous ship with it.
------
A FOMORIAN FALLS
------
Our coordinated attacks have worked... this time. There may be other Fomorians coming. We need to destroy them or suffer resource shortages in the future.
------
Archive of Tenno Operations...
------
Honorable Board

I'm proud to report that Sling-Stone was a success! The Fomorian ships have been reduced to radioactive scraps drifting through the system... 

The Betrayers did our work for us. Billions saved in potential damages. I just dangled some Mod technology in front of their noses and let their homicidal nature do the rest. Too easy!

The Grineer have returned to the bargaining table but something in their tone irks me. I've dispatched scouts to Pluto - I suspect the Grineer may have held a few Fomorians in reserve.

GRADIVUS DILEMMA
------
Tenno,

We have a situation developing. Alad V and his Corpus troops were on the verge of capturing a long lost group of Tenno still locked in cryo stasis. Things escalated quickly when Sargas Ruk of the Grineer discovered the plan and demanded the frames for himself. Alad V refused and so Ruk ordered his territory confiscated. Fighting broke out a short time ago. At this point either side could win and only we can tip the balance.

Tenno, I cannot in good conscience tell you who to support in this conflict. If you choose to fight for Sargas Ruk, you can save the sleeping Tenno but the Grineer will grow even stronger. Fight for the Corpus and weaken Grineer supremacy but our comrades fall to the mercy of Alad V. 

Choose wisely.

Lotus
------
GRADIVUS DECIDED
------
Tenno,
I have intercepted a message from the Corpus Board to Alad V. They have grown tired of bankrolling Alad V's war effort and have withdrawn their funding. This has left Alad with no other option than retreat. Sargas Ruk is already readying his victory speech. This battle is over.

You have all done well. Those of you who supported the Grineer have given me the time I needed to locate our sleeping comrades. A recovery team is already travelling to retrieve their cryopods. Those that supported The Corpus have slowed Grineer aggression. Though the Grineer ultimately emerged victorious, they did so at great cost.
The time for partnerships with these warlords has ended. We are no longer forced to support them in their petty conflicts. We must return to our stated goal of bringing balance to the solar system.

------
UPGRADES / MODS
------
UNLOCK YOUR POWER
A Tenno improves their Arsenal with special upgrades called Mods.

There are hundreds of Mods that can be found and combined to enhance your weapons and augment your Warframe.

It is up to you to decide how you will combine these Mods to suit your fighting style.
------
SEEK THE OLD WAYS

Installing a Mod is done in the Upgrade section of the Arsenal. 

Use the AUTO-EQUIP feature until you become familiar with the Mod system.

Mods are collected in many ways - most can be found as loot dropped by specific enemies. 

The Codex and Codex Scanner allow you to scan enemies and learn about which Mods they might be carrying.
------
KNOW YOUR MOD

NAME - Check the Codex for a list of what is possible!
DRAIN - This is the capacity cost for equipping this Mod.
POLARITY - In the upgrade screen you will see that Mod Slots will often be attuned to a specific Polarity. Matching Mods to Slot Polarities significantly reduce the drain, while Mods that do not match will increase the drain.
FUSION - You can increase the level of a Mod through Fusion. This will increase both its effectiveness and drain.
CONCLAVE - This value contributes to your overall Conclave rating. This limits which Player vs. Player Conclaves you may fight in.
ITEM - This determines the type of item this Mod can be installed in. It may refer to a broad range of weapon types or a specific weapon.
UPGRADE - Describes the effect this Mod has on your item. Statistical benefits will rise if you apply Fusion to the Mod.
RARITY - Indicates how rare this Mod is in the world.
------
FUSION

Collecting a Mod is just the first step. Most Mods can be upgraded through a process called Fusion. You can increase the power of a Mod by fusing other Mods into it. Mods fused to upgrade other Mods are destroyed in the process.

Fusion is most effective when fusing duplicate Mods, rare Mods or Fusion Cores, a special type of Mod that can only be fused to upgrade other Mods.
------
PLAN YOUR PATH

When a Tenno has learned enough they begin to bend the rules of the system by augmenting their gear with Orokin technology...

Orokin Reactors and Catalysts increase the Mod capacity of Weapons and Warframes respectively.

Forma allows a Tenno to modify the polarity of a Mod slot in their item. In this way they optimize their Mod configuration for even greater power.

Auras are special Warframe Mods, designed to help your entire team and actually boost your Mod capacity!

To reach perfection, a Tenno must meditate on the depths of the Mods system.
------
Crafting / Foundry
------
FASHION YOUR STEEL
The Foundry is the key to creating the most powerful items in the Solar System.
------
STUDY THE COMPONENTS
Using the Foundry requires Blueprints (found in the market and on missions) and Resources which are dropped by the enemies you kill. 

Enter the battlefield to collect resources, and use them in the Foundry!
------
SEEK THE WEAPONS
Warframes are rare and extremely powerful - building one in the Foundry may require you to assemble multiple parts. Clan research may be involved.

The Solar System is home to many things that require numerous blueprints to complete. The hunt is on, Tenno!
------
KNOW THE DESIGNS
Building in the Foundry begins by having the necessary resources and blueprints.

Builds in progress can be rushed, and any item can be built more than once. Keep in mind you can build more than one item at a time.

Take note of the required build time, Tenno!
------
BUILD YOUR FUTURE
Explore the Solar System to find all the resources to build a variety of items.

Advanced players may use the Foundry to craft Titan Extractors, a drone capable of securing resources outside of your missions.
------
Damage
------
KNOW YOUR LIMITATIONS
Tenno, enemies you face have a variety of defenses.

SHIELDS protect enemies and can regenerate over time. You must destroy it completely before you can damage an enemy's health. 

ARMOR is worn by enemies to reduce damage to their health. Prepare yourself to do high armor damage as you explore your Arsenal.

HEALTH is how your enemies survive. Destroying all of their health will ensure their demise.
------
STRIKE TRUE AND LAST
Physical damage is made up of three parts: 

IMPACT <DT_IMPACT>, PUNCTURE <DT_PUNCTURE>, and SLASH <DT_SLASH>

Weapons tend to be a blend of these types. They can be Modded to specialize further. Use these wisely against Shielded and Armored enemies. 

Weapons can perform Critical Strikes for increased damage. Look for Mods that enhance these effects!

Each damage type has a chance to put a lasting Status Effect on your enemies, making them vulnerable! If this happens you, you will see the damage type symbol on your Hud like this: <DT_SLASH>
------
BEND THE ELEMENTS
Elemental damage can be applied in addition to physical damage.  There are four primary elemental damage types...

FIRE <DT_FIRE> damage will burn and scorch foes.

ELECTRICITY <DT_ELECTRICITY> damage is capable of stunning and damaging enemies.

COLD <DT_FREEZE> damage can slow down enemies and deal damage.

TOXIN <DT_POISON> damage is effective at damaging an enemy's health!
------
KNOW YOUR ENEMY
Enemies you face may have different resistances and weaknesses to various elements. Use the Codex Scanner to learn more about their weaknesses to specific types of damage.

Each +/- listed indicates 25% change. For example:

Damage bonus from Electricity (75%): <DT_ELECTRICITY>+++

Resistance to Puncture (50%): <DT_PUNCTURE>--
------
COMBINE ATTACKS FOR GREATER FORMS
A Tenno Master may go even further, combining the four primary elemental damage types to create secondary ones.

<DT_EXPLOSION> BLAST (<DT_FIRE>+<DT_FREEZE>)
<DT_RADIATION> RADIATION (<DT_FIRE>+<DT_ELECTRICITY>)
<DT_GAS> GAS (<DT_FIRE>+<DT_POISON>)
<DT_MAGNETIC> MAGNETIC (<DT_FREEZE>+<DT_ELECTRICITY>)
<DT_VIRAL> VIRAL (<DT_FREEZE>+<DT_POISON>)
<DT_CORROSIVE> CORROSIVE (<DT_ELECTRICITY>+<DT_POISON>)

Use Mods to extend and mutate the damage potential of your most powerful weapons!
------
Sentinels
------
BATTLE COMPANION

Sentinels aid Tenno on the battlefield by reinforcing many areas of support. Sentinels can be built in the Foundry or purchased in the Market.
------
USE HARMONY IN YOUR ATTACKS

Sentinels can offer support in many ways, including Stealth, Damage, Crowd Control, and picking up Loot!
------
PASS ON YOUR EXPERIENCES

Sentinels can be modified to suit your needs - equipping precepts will customize your Sentinels behavior.

The order which you equip determines the priority, from top left to bottom right.
------
Clans
------
STRENGTH IN NUMBERS

Click on the Clan (Shield) button in the top menu, then click the Create Button.

Choose a name, and if its available, your clan will be created!

There are many tiers of Clan sizes to suit your preference, whether you want to be apart of a vast, 1000-member Moon Clan or a tight-knit Ghost Clan of 10-members.
------
BUILD YOUR FORTRESS

When you first join or create a Warframe clan you will be given a blueprint for a Dojo Key. You can forge this key in your Foundry.

Find your Clan Key on your list of void keys and then press the Use button located in the bottom right of the void key screen.

If you see a door with glowing red outlines, this is an open node. You can interact with this door to bring up a menu that will let you choose a room to start constructing at this node.

With construction projects comes costs. When a room or decoration is under construction, members must donate their resources to see their projects completed.
------
RESEARCH NEW TECHNOLOGY

Some weapons and Warframes can only be created through research in Clan Tech Labs.

In order to craft these items you must first construct an Oracle.

Once completed you will be able to create Laboratories that focus on Tenno, Grineer, Corpus or Infested technology.
------
FOR HONOR, FOR GLORY

Care for some friendly competition Tenno? Often you will find special events occurring that will require the attention of all your clan members.

The Lotus rewards those clans that have shown exemplary skill with badges for all members of the clan, or trophies of vanquished enemies for your clan's Dojo.
------
SHARING IS CARING

Building a Trading Post in your Dojo allows clan members (and invitees) to trade Mods and keys in the Dojo. Trades are taxed and the Clan may increase the taxation rate to line their coffers.

You will find the Trading Post in the Decorations section.
------
BUILD YOUR EMPIRE

There are many decorative rooms, game-play spaces and majestic areas you can build to bring honor to your clan. There are meeting halls, dueling rooms, obstacle courses and more.

The Tenno are constantly expanding the possibilities of what they can build!
------
PVP / Conclaves
------
TEST YOUR SKILLS

Conclaves have been established as an area for Tenno to duel each other in friendly battle. Matches of 1vs1, 1vs2, 2vs1, and 2vs2 can be played.
------
MEASURE YOUR OPPONENTS

Your Conclave Rating will determine which arena/opponents you can duel.

Your total is determined by the level of your weapons, your Warframe and by which Mods you have equipped.

Check your Arsenal stats in the lower right to see the Conclave ratings. Adding Mods on a weapon or Warframe will affect the Conclave Rating, and the stronger the Mod is the higher your Conclave Rating will be.
------
FIND CONCLAVES

There are many Conclaves in the Solar System. Each Conclave has it's own Rating which determines the Tenno that may duel there.

Conclave arenas have health, energy, and ammo pickups distributed in them. Best 2 out of 3 matches will determine the winning side, but you may choose to continue dueling after the battle has ended.
------
NEW WAYS WILL EMERGE

The Conclaves are a foundation for Tenno to battle each other. More opportunities to test yourselves will come.
------
Dark Sectors
------
Solar Rails are colossal Orokin devices that distort the Void and allow players to reach otherwise inaccessible regions of space, known as Dark Sectors. Clans and Alliances can deploy Solar Rails to control these areas on the Solar Map, collecting tributes from players who access areas within their territory.
------
Once an Oracle has been built, Clans are able to construct Orokin Labs in their Dojos. Clan Warlords and Tacticians can research blueprints and construct Solar Rails from the terminals located inside the Orokin Lab. Small clans can unite to form Alliances, and are able to construct an Alliance Solar Rail. All clans within the Alliance may contribute toward the research and construction of the Solar Rail.
------
Researching a Solar Rail blueprint requires resource contributions from clan members. The resources required scales with the size of the Clan. Once research is complete, construction on the Solar Rail can begin. The resource requirements of a Solar Rail however, do not scale with the size of the clan, so it is imperative for small clans to form an Alliance to expedite the construction process.
------
Once construction has been completed, clans and Alliances are able to deploy their Solar Rails on specified Dark Sectors of the Solar Map. The Clan or Alliance controlling the Solar Rail will be able to specify a tribute, collecting a percentage of any resources or credits collected by players using the Solar Rail.
------
If another clan already controls a Dark Sector, owner ship can be contested by deploying a Solar Rail into their territory. Deploying a second Solar Rail within close proximity of another causes interference with the Void-Disruption Technology used to reach the Dark Sectors. This prevents other Tenno from accessing these regions of space while both Solar Rails are active.
------
When conflict over Solar Rails controlled by rival Clans or Alliances arises, Tenno have the opportunity to fight for either side by undertaking missions. Missions played for one side cause damage to the opposing Solar Rail. Clans may offer Battle Pay to those who side with them to gain additional support.
------
Once one Solar Rail has taken critical damage, it is destroyed. The clan that controls the surviving Solar Rail takes control of that Dark Sector, and begin collecting tribute from other Tenno who access it.

If both rails still exist after two days, the energy interference of the two conflicting rails increases exponentially. This causes a meltdown in the Solar Rail which sustained the most damage, leading to its destruction. The energy of the remaining Solar Rail then stabilizes, allowing all Tenno to access the Dark Sector again and resume paying tribute to the Clan or Alliance controlling the Solar Rail.
------
Melee 2.0
------
Tenno can engage their enemies in close quarter combat, by holding <NEXT_INV> to draw their melee weapon. 

Once equipped a Tenno will be able to realize the full potential of their training by executing combos with <MELEE>

Parry incoming attacks with <MELEE_PARRY>. Tenno can deflect both blades and bullets with ease.

To sheath you weapon, hold <NEXT_INV> again and your firearm will be drawn.
------
Tenno can enhance their attacks by channeling their energy into their weapon by holding down <MELEE_CHANNEL>. 

With perfect timing, Tenno can parry an incoming melee attack from an enemy with <MELEE_PARRY> while channeling, to stagger them.

Using their quick reflexes, a Tenno can follow up with an Execution by tapping <MELEE> while standing close to their staggered target.
------
Equip Stance Mods in the Arsenal to unlock devastating combos to unleash upon your enemies. One such Stance Mod is called Crimson Dervish.

Crimson Dervish can be equipped on single bladed weapons, like the Skana and allows the user to trigger combos by pressing the correct button sequence. 

One of the attacks unique to Crimson Dervish is the Coiling Impale. It is is a four-strike attack that can be triggered by pressing <MELEE> , <MELEE> , <MELEE> , <MELEE_PARRY> + <MELEE>
------
Collect Stance Mods to unlock a variety of attacks for your favourite Melee Weapons.

Only one Stance Mod may be equipped at a time, though most weapons will have a selection of Stance Mods to choose from.

Special Attacks will feature new and exciting animations.

Check out the COMBO button after equipping a Stance Mod, or from the Pause Menu during a mission to see a full list of special attacks.
------
Primary Weapon and Secondary Weapons can be unequipped in the Arsenal.
                      
Try taking missions with only your Melee Weapon equipped for the ultimate Tenno challenge!

TARGET: Ava Izar

Ava's political career exploded when she launched "Ava's Children", a charity program to feed starving off-world orphans. During the airing of her (now legendary) "Plea for the Forgotten" Ava's tear-duct implants malfunctioned. Stunned audiences mistook this as an emotional display and the donations poured in. Ava won hearts and minds for the Grineer Empire.

Now, under her direct supervision, the charity program produces the majority of Grineer combat munitions. "Ava's Children" live shortened lives in orbital labor camps.

"Children are our future."

TARGET: Sargus Ruk

Sargas Ruk claims to be a self-made man. He rose from humble beginnings as a Grineer Freighter hand to the rank of Fleet Minister. Ruk's appointment was a surprise to those that knew him. He had little education, a 'denied' reproduction rating, and one of the lowest intellect scores seen in ambulatory Grineer. Yet, Ruk has an uncanny ability to influence those around him - incredible given his speech is nearly incomprehensible (he has an enormous tongue deformity).

Perhaps Ruk's inexplicable rise to power has its origins in his humbler days. He worked Orokin recovery missions for the fleet. Ruk's detractors insist he has Orokin technology that weakens will. To date, 100% of these accusations have been withdrawn.

The Sentients had won. They had turned our weapons, our technology, against us. The more advanced we became, the greater our losses. The war was over unless we found a new way. In our desperation we turned to the Void. The blinding night, the hellspace where our science and reason failed.

We took the twisted few that had returned from that place. We built a frame around them, a conduit of their affliction. Gave them the weapons of the old ways. Gun and blade. A new warrior, a new code was born. These rejects, these Tenno, became our saviors. Warrior-Gods cast in steel and fury striking our enemies in a way they could never comprehend.

Excalibur was the first.

-Orokin 'Warframe' Archives
------
Some have walked these desolate worlds while you slept. Some like me. I remember what you did. I remember the day.

The Tenno appeared at the Terminus, gleaming and victorious. Our cold and gold Emperors, breathless, bathed you in savior's silk. Then came the sound. Across all our worlds, all at once, the ceremonial Naga drums. A royal salute to the honored Tenno. Ten solemn beats to declare the suffering was over. I watched from a distance, with the rest of the low Guardians. With each beat terror began to crush my throat. The Tenno were not stoic and silent. They were waiting. They were poised. I tried to call out but only a strangled whisper escaped.

When the ninth beat rang a torrent of blood filled the stadium, loosed by Tenno blades. The drums, the Empire, fell silent forever.

Now I hunt, dividing your numbers. Watching from that dark place, cataloging your sins, I am the ghost of retribution. You may forget but you are not innocent.
------
Most Honored Councilor Vay Hek,

The agony treatment has worked! Tests show aggression has been shifted to The Tenno. The Grustrag Three are now ready for release and are eager for your orders.

Please note: fratricide is still an issue. Conditioning did not completely remove violent tendencies toward fellow Grineer. My solution is the Grustrag Bolt. When attached to a subject, this device limits combat effectiveness against all Grineer personnel. The bolt will ensure collateral death is acceptably limited. 

I have produced a surplus of these devices. Perhaps these will also aid you with your problem?

Your Loyal Servant,

Doctor Tengus
Director Grustrag Reconditioning Facility
------
Vay Hek,

Releasing the Grustrag Three? Tell me this rumor is a lie. Tell me you have not forgotten what those defects cost me. Traitors must be eradicated but you think they can be rehabilitated? Arrogance. If it were up to me, Grustrag and everyone in it would be ash. No Doctor can cure disloyalty.

The responsibility for this mistake is yours alone. Trust me, you will bleed regret.

In Bad Taste
------
Rumors have surfaced of a human trafficking ring operating in the Inner District targeting one of our civilian colonies. The true nature of the activities is unknown, though it appears to be Grineer in origin. 

Infiltrate the cargo-freighter implicated in the allegations and collect intel on the ring.
------
Ending Credits
------
For years, the Corpus elite have embedded credit chips under their skin as a sign of rank and privilege. Now they have come to realize the chips are toxic.

A Corpus Deacon named "Solma" has begun a campaign to redesign the credit currency. He hopes to preserve Corpus customs while reducing the alarming decline of Corpus leadership. If Solma is successful, it could devalue our reserves and restrict our ability to purchase arms on the free-market.

Infiltrate one of Solma's freighters and collect Intel on his plan.

Solma: "We must forge a new path for our collective..."
------
Well done. With no one to champion the proposed redesign, we have effectively secured our reserves. We will continue to keep a close eye on this.
------
A Pestilence Walketh
------
We mourn the loss of our people. Thanks to you they did not die in vain. We now know that Technocyte has detrimental effects on Grineer physiology.
------
Into The Void
------
Evidence unearthed at a Corpus excavation site on a Plutonian moon points to the existence of an Orokin artifact aboard a derelict ship. This could be the key to re-enabling the rail. A Corpus research vessel is en route.

Intercept the ship and acquire the artifact before it leaves in Corpus hands.
------
In Fest Interests
------
We have received a distress call from one of our operatives following a lead on an abandoned artifact excavation site. The operative was tailing a Corpus security force that had been spotted coming and going from the site. Upon arrival at the site, he was overwhelmed by Infestation.

Infiltrate the facility and extract our brother.
------
The Corpus are on the brink of isolating the DNA that causes the infection and are in the process of developing it for use as a biological weapon. The original samples containing the infection have been sent to a Corpus production facility for manufacturing.

It is imperative you infiltrate the site and destroy every last sample.
------
Good work. You have eliminated the threat of a potentially devastating biological weapon.
------
Will Power
------
With Skelk gone, we can only hope that he did not pass along his knowledge of Orokin technology.
------
No Clone Of Their Own
------
For centuries Grineer cloning technology has been controlled by the Corpus, who have locked the Grineer into financial dependence for grafts and antidotes. Recently, the Grineer have begun experimenting with their own tech; a dangerous proposition.

It is in our best interests to ensure that the Corpus control all aspects of cloning tech. To allow the Grineer to control their own tech is tantamount to extinction for our people.

Infiltrate this Grineer research facility and destroy all traces of the cloning tech.
------
With Ayeri gone, we have put a dent in Grineer plans to control their very own destiny.
------
There looks to be several locations on this facility containing cloning tech. Expect heavy resistance from the Grineer.
------
School's Out
------
Beld has had countless threats against his life. As a result, he now travels with a large security team comprised of robotic proxies. Tread carefully.
------
Children Are Our Future
------
Great work. With Izar gone, the program has dismantled. Our children will no longer suffer for the Grineer cause.
------
Strained
------
A long-time Tenno sympathizer has tipped us off to the location of a strain of experimental Grineer DNA containing technocyte.

The informant, a Grineer geneticist, requires the DNA samples for clandestine work being done to ensure Orokin technology can never be adapted for Grineer use. He knows that if his people harness the ancient technology, the solar system is in grave danger.

Intercept this Grineer research vessel and extract each of the canisters containing the modified DNA. It is in our best interests that he is able to continue his work.
------
Good work. Our informant can now continue his research. We have adapted some of his work on Grineer technology for you to use.
------
The canisters containing the DNA are scattered throughout the ship. Security is high... stay alert, and eliminate all those in your way.
------
The Jackal
------
I am sworn protector of this system. Leave now or pay with your head!
------
I've sent word to the ruling Sisters. Reinforcements will be arriving soon.
------
Are you still alive? I suppose it is better this way. I have room for one more head in my collection!
------
I look forward to meeting you.
------
Time to had another Tenno head to my collection.
------
You look weak. Nervous. I hope that expression comes out for my trophy case.
------
(We were countless. Consume us. Be reborn.)
------
(Why do you destroy us? We are your flesh.)
------
(We embrace you. Why do you defile us?)
------
Trivial threat detected.
------
Threat level upgraded. Classification: Pathetic.
------
Prototype engagement test: Ready. Tenno destruction analytics: Recording.
------
Hmmm... An amazing specimen. The Warframe parts alone will double my quarterly results. Prepare the Autopsy-Bots!
------
Why are you destroying profits in this way?! Its fiscally irresponsible to continue this assault!
------
I understand your impulse for justice but this is very bad for profit.
------
The death of Sergeant Nef Anyo should weaken the Corpus Research and Development operations for some time.
------
The death of Arn Etina means the corpus mineral pipeline has been severed. Robotics production will be disrupted for weeks.
------
The defeat of Grineer Captain Vor opens up other regions for the Tenno.
------
The death of Counciler Vay Hek will bring all Grineer deployments to a halt.
------
Eliminating a Grineer General will render the Saturn region helplessly unorganized.
------
Kela de Thaym's death will no doubt cause ripples of dissension amongst the inner circles of Grineer nobility.
------
The Raptor is the most recent heavy weapon prototype developed by the Corpus. You must destroy it before they can begin full scale production.
------
Fusion Moa Army
------
The Corpus have deployed millions of Orokin fused Moas in Europa. All Tenno must work together to eradicate this threat...
------
If we wipe out this entire force in time, their point of origin will be revealed. We suspect a valuable Relic may be of use to us.
------
Informers Terminated
------
The Grineer have deployed millions of cloaking spy drones! We must destroy these quickly before they undermine our ability to strike undetected.
------
If we can irradicate enough of these drones it may reveal a hidden weapons cache. Did the Grineer hijack a Corpus weapons shipment?
------
Vor's Prize
------
After centuries of sleep you are awake. Your Warframe armor is weak. Your skills all but forgotten.

A Grineer General, Vor, stands over you...
"You are mine, Tenno!"
------
Destroying a single reactor will not be enough to take down a Fomorian. We will need to poison the well... coordinated teams will corrupt it's fuel supply. This will require gear harvested from Infestation tissues. I will route you to an injector point...
------
These Fomorians are massive, keep searching. You will need to locate a fuel cell and inject the corrupting agent. I hope you have a corruptor with you.
------
Remember, if you are coordinating with other Tenno the Alpha/Beta mixtures are more potent, but a single Tenno cannot equip them at once.
------
There it is! You should be able to inject the corruptor you brought using the attached console.
------
Excellent, the corruption process has begun. You must defend this position to ensure the Grineer do not destroy this fuel cell before it spreads through the ship.
------
Corruption process is complete. Good work Tenno. Get to extraction where I will record your contribution to the operation!

The Battle Versus The War
------
The dogs claim victory. Do they really think I am defeated? They are nothing more than squatters on my property. Let them get comfortable. Let them be distracted by the disgusting needs of their replicated flesh. Meanwhile, my forces get ever closer to perfection. Arrogance and complacency will be their downfall.
 
Tenno, know that your support in this fight will ensure my eventual victory. It is only a matter of time. I have awarded you a bonus commensurate with your effort. I will not forget what you have done for me.
-Alad V

You have cut down countless Grineer. Rabid dogs that will never again threaten us, but what of the others? Take this Prova Vandal, continue your work. We have much left to accomplish.

Our Victory at Gradivus

He runs like a coward. He watches his profits crumble. Grineer feast atop the broken heaps of his defeated children. There was never any other fate. There was only ever one outcome. He knows what comes next.
 
You made the right choice. You became Grineer. You have earned your rewards.
 
And I, I will remember how you have served me.

Darvo's Deals are Back
------
Friends!

You did it, you got that freak off my back. Well, some of you did and some of you didn't quite make it, but I won't hold that against any of you. What matters is I can now come out of hiding and that means more deals for everyone.

To celebrate this occasion I have put together the Super Charge Pack. It is everything you need to take your Warframe to the next level, including boosters, an Orokin Reactor and Catalyst, Forma and even extra Warframe and weapon slots. Because there is no longer a price on my head you all get half price on this deal. That's right 50% off this amazing pack.

I'm not done yet either, keep an eye out for more deals over the next couple of days.

-Darvo
------
Just a Small Favor?
------
My friends,

I have a small favor to ask of you. No, no, favor is the wrong word. You don't get paid for favors but for this I can pay you. Not in advance of course, but when you are done there will be plenty to go around. Hell, once this is done, I'll be able to offer you my deals again. 

Let me get to the point. There's a ship. A ship I own but am not in currently in possession of. All you need to do is sneak onto this ship and take care of a something for me. Nothing major, I know you can handle the work. I'll explain when you're on board. 

What do you say, will you help your old friend Darvo out?

Oh and by the way, I'd appreciate it if you keep this between you and me. There is no reason for the Lotus to know about this little arrangement.

-Darvo
------
Let me make it up to you
------
Friends,

I am hearing a very troubling rumor. Apparently, some of you feel that I took advantage of the Tenno. That I should have warned you I was luring a very dangerous assassin to your location so that you could kill him for me. But friends, had I warned you, you may not have helped and where would that leave me? You want me back in business don't you?

Look, let me make it up to you. Courtesy of your hard work I have a very special bundle for you. A Nekros Warframe, the Carrier Sentinel, a Soma rifle and the ever deadly Ether Reaper. All at half the usual market prices. Come on Tenno, tell me a deal like that isn't worth a little risk?

-Darvo
------
One More Deal
------
Tenno,

I have one more deal for you. What do you think of a pack containing the Dread bow, Despair throwing blades and a Hate scythe? The Tenno who helped me out will know firsthand just how destructive these weapons can be. Last time I offered this pack I got myself into a little bit of hot water. Now, thanks to your efforts, the pressure is off and this time I can offer this deal at half price.

As for me, I am running out of stock but I have a hot tip on some new product. Don't worry though Tenno, I have learned my lesson. Everything will be above board from now on. Trust me.

So long for now,
Darvo
------
A Proposition
------
Tenno,

Between us we have three problems. 

Alad stole your people. He cut them to pieces, welded them into his freak Zanuka. You need to stop him before he makes more but you don't know where he is. This is your problem.

For me, Alad V is a con and an imposter. Still, if Zanuka is brought to full production he will become the richest and most powerful member of the Corpus Board. He could become Chairman. That is my problem. 

I have sent my forces to Jupiter to capture the criminal but Alad is using that damned infestation as a biological weapon. Every last ship has been overrun by those monsters. This is now your problem. Wipe those ships clean and I will reveal Alad V's location. With that information, you can make the rest of our problems go away. Deal?

-Frohd Bek
------
Problem Eliminated
------
You have lived up to your end of the bargain, now I will live up to mine. Themisto, that is where you will find Alad V. Cowering behind his pet, doing unspeakable things to you and yours.  Do me a favor, don't go easy on him. He hasn't earned your pity.

Our arrangement has been fruitful Tenno. Take this gift as a symbol of my appreciation. Maybe we can scratch each other's backs again someday.

-Frohd Bek
------
(TEMP TEXT) Now your weapons are mine, fool! Mwa ha ha ha!
------
Glory Awaits
------
People of the Grineer,

Earth is the jewel in our crown yet so much of it remains unexploited. Its forests have been invaded by overgrown Orokin engineered super-weeds. When we cut them down, they grow back. We build our bases, they overtake them. We have tried to work within the forests, we have tried to tame the forests, our capitulation has become weakness. 

The Cicero Toxin will break these forests and impose our will on the landscape. My scientist have pinpointed a chemical weakness that is common to ninety percent of the vegetation in the central region. Over the next several days we will exploit that weakness causing our enemy to wilt and decay. We will finally settle what is rightfully ours.

Your Greatness,
Councilor Vay Hek

Operation Oxium Espionage: Completed
------
Tenno,

With your contribution we have already begun researching new Warframe possibilities. The research is ongoing but so far the results have been exciting. You will be updated further when concrete progress has been achieved. 

In the meantime, take this reward which is active immediately and continue to maintain the balance.

Operation Oxium Espionage
------
Tenno,

Weeks ago we received intel about a Corpus raid on a little-known independent research facility near Eris. The Corpus made off with a scientific jackpot, the formulation of a rediscovered experimental Orokin alloy called Oxium. This lighter than air alloy has already been deployed in a new drone dubbed the Oxium Osprey which forgoes its support role in favor of dynamic attacks. 

With this new drone The Corpus think they have gained the upper hand but we will use this development to our own ends.  Oxium could be the cornerstone of new Warframe design but first we need to research its properties. Go into the field, take out the new Ospreys and bring back the Oxium. You will be rewarded for your efforts.

-Lotus
------
OXIUM ESPIONAGE
------
OPERATION: Destroy Oxium Ospreys to retrieve rare Oxium alloy.

Vor's Defeat
------
Your triumph over Captain Vor was an impressive but your journey has only just begun.    

Our enemies are abundant and their strength continues to grow. Your skills are formidable but the outlying planet regions are fraught with peril. Skill alone will not keep you alive. Accept this gift of |CREDIT_REWARD|<CREDITS>. The Market contains powerful weapons and items that will serve you well. Expand your Arsenal and fight to restore the balance within this System. 

-Lotus

TIES THAT BIND
------
Tenno,

It seems I am again in a bit of trouble. Wait, before you go jumping to conclusions, I swear, this time it is not my fault. I used to belong to this organization, the problem is this organization has refused to accept my resignation. I guess certain people cannot live without my skills. This is understandable as I am very good at what I do. I just prefer to work without a plasma turret pointed at my head. I am sure you understand.

Now, I know what you are thinking. The last time you helped me you got a little more than you bargained for. Things worked out in the end though, right? Help me again and I will make it worth your while. Trust me.

Darvo
------
Returning the Favor
------
Tenno,

Friends do things for each other and Tenno you have done so much for me. What kind of friend would I be if I did not extend my best deals to you? Things are a little bit hairy for me right now but that does not mean you are out of luck, I have had some of my closest associates setup these deals on my behalf. 

Now, I know you have a sword but do you have a great sword? If not then check out the Galatine, a true Great Sword. Nobody is going to mess with you if you have this thing, I swear. For today only, half off the usual market price.

Stick around. There are more deals where that came from.

Darvo
------
Last Minute Deal
------
Tenno,

Things have been so crazy for me that I almost forgot to tell you about today's deal. Lately, it would seem that you are my knight in shining armor, so I am going to offer you the Paladin Bundle. You get the Oberon Warframe,  Magistar Mace, Stug Gel Gun and Karak Automatic Rifle all at half off the usual market price. Pretty good, no?

Darvo
------
Survive in Style
------
Tenno,

All this time I have spent in incarceration recently really had me thinking about Earth. The lush, sprawling, overgrown, genetically mutated, super forests can be really scenic this time of year. I am not the only one thinking this way, forest inspired gear is very fashionable right now and guess what? I have the market cornered. So let's talk deals.

Here we go, today's deal is The Forest-Camo Skin Pack. Stylish skins for 13 of your favorite weapons all at half-price. This is the real-deal too, there will be no cheap knock-offs for Darvo's friends. What do you say?

Darvo
------
Valuable Information
------
Tenno,

It is good to be free. There is no way that neck breathing control freak is going to tell me what to do. I am my own man.

Speaking of Frohd Bek, I think you may be wondering about something he said. Usually information of this nature is very, very expensive but I am in your debt so I will pass this along at no charge.

Here is what I know. My father is scared, very scared. The Corpus are losing control of long held planets and the Grineer just keep pushing. Now they are working on something called Project Tethra. Old wheezy does not know what it is but he knows enough to be worried. Maybe your Lotus can make some sense of this information? Either way, it is not my problem. They are all just going to try and kill each other anyway. The most you can try and do is make some profit out of the whole situation, right?

Darvo
------
A Warning
------
Tenno, actions against the Grineer will not be tolerated. Continue to work against us and you will be hunted down and punished. You have been warned.

Councilor Vay Hek
------
A Lesson
------
Interfering with our operations is unacceptable. You will be shown your place.  Your punishment has been ordered.

Councilor Vay Hek
------
You continue to assist our enemies. Your meddling will NOT be tolerated.
------
Shackled
------
The Grineer have attached a corruption device called the Grustrag Bolt to your Warframe. It will cripple your powers when you attempt to fight against them. However, you can remove the device by crafting the attached blueprint. Good luck.

Tethra's Doom
------
Tenno

We must move quickly. We have learned the nature of Project Tethra, Vay Hek is rebuilding the Fomorian Fleet. His aim is nothing less than complete domination of the Origin System. Thousands of these monstrous ships are in production. The Grineer will become unstoppable if they are completed. We must not let this happen.

Our goal is to cripple these ships before they can be deployed. To do this we are going to target the Fomorian Power Cores, their most vital component. This will be easier said than done. The cores are heavily guarded and their precise location is a tightly kept secret. 

First we must find the cores. The Grineer are coordinating construction using a highly sophisticated encrypted communication system. To defeat this encryption intercept multiple Data Fragments and then combine them using the Tethra Cipher Blueprint I have sent you. When you have located a core, I will give you further instructions.

Lotus
------
Tethra's Doom - Stage 2
------
Excellent, you have located a Fomorian Power Core. The Grineer are in the process of transporting it for installation. This is our chance to strike but this is also where things get tricky. We cannot destroy the core on the planet. The fallout from such an explosion would create a wasteland lasting for generations. Instead we must hijack the core and escort it to an waiting ship. From there it will be taken to space for destruction. 

This mission is risky. If the core ruptures there will be nowhere to run and death will be certain. 

Good luck Tenno,
Lotus
------
Tethra's Doom - Escalation
------
We have a problem. Our analysis of Vay Hek's broadcast has revealed the existence of a second type of Fomorian Core. While we have been chasing Power Cores, Vay Hek successfully armed many of his ships with Shield Cores. He already has a head start, we cannot waste anymore time. 

I have provided you with a modified Tethra Shield Cipher Blueprint. It will let you locate these new cores. 

Beware, Vay Hek is ready for us now. He has seen our strategies and had a chance to evolve his own. This mission will not be easy.

The exceptional efforts of |CLAN_NAME| in thwarting Councilor Vay Hek have not gone unnoticed. Take this trophy and display it with pride, you earned it.

Lotus
------
We Have Come So Far
------
|DisplayName|,

It has been one Earth cycle since I called the first Tenno to wake from cryostasis. Since that day countless more have joined our fold. In that time much has changed. As our enemies grew stronger you mastered new Waframes. When they plotted for power, you toppled tyrants. When they hunted us, you showed them what it meant to challenge the Tenno.

To commemorate your accomplishments I have crafted the Dex Furis. Master this weapon and use it with pride, Tenno.

Your guide,
The Lotus

A Gift From the Lotus
------
|PLAYER_NAME|, 

You have fought long and hard for our cause. Take this gift as a token of my appreciation. 

The Lotus 
------
Silencing Vay Hek
------
Tenno,

Councilor Vay Hek is vulnerable. The failure of Project Tethra was so devastating that he has been forced into hiding. This is our chance, I need you to find Hek and take him out. 

Hek has consolidated his remaining shipbuilding on Ceres. To protect the operation, he's sent in his personal guardsmen, deadly Prosecutor class fighters. Ever paranoid, Hek has each Prosecutor carry a locator beacon so he can track them at all times. His paranoia will be his undoing. Collect enough locator beacons and you can use this Frequency Triangulator to determine his whereabouts.

Do not assume this will be easy. Not only are the Prosecutors viscious melee fighters but reconnaissance shows their auras create a new type of shield barrier, impervious to most types of damage. Getting through those shields will be difficult. You will need to experiment to find their weaknesses. 

Go to Ceres, defeat the Prosecutors to locate Vay Hek, and then take the fight to his doorstep. 

-The Lotus

SPECTERS OF LIBERTY
------
We need your help...
------
Tenno,

This is Cantis of the Red Veil Resistance and I am asking for your help. You fight the Grineer and Corpus and so do we, that makes us allies. We aren't as strong as you and we don't have your weapons but we've pissed off those bastards just the same. Now they're coming after us, systematically capturing our comrades and holding them hostage. Using our brothers and sisters as pawns against us. Tenno, will you help us bring them home?

If you are going to do this, you must strike quickly and quietly. If you are seen, the enemy will execute our hostage before you can rescue them. Please, do not give them this chance. 

We can't offer you much but we do have large cache of Specter blueprints. Bring home our people and we will share these with you. Those who go above and beyond will receive a special token of our appreciation.

Thank you Tenno,

Cantis
------
You Are Making the Difference
------
Tenno,

We are in your debt. The hostages you saved would have been doomed without you. Take this badge. It shows your solidarity with the Red Veil movement. 

Remember, there are still many more operatives out there and we're counting on you to bring them home.

Cantis

------
A Symbol of Our Gratitude
------
Tenno,

You have brought so many of our comrades home. We never thought we would see them again, yet here they are, thanks to you. Take this Rakta Syandana, it is one of the highest honors bestowed on our operatives. The Red Veil would be proud to see you wear it |PLAYER_NAME|.

Keep up the fight Tenno,

Cantis

So happy I can add more |CLAN_NAME| notches to my belt!

|PLAYER_NAME| are you sure |PLAYER_NAMEB| will be there for you when you fall?

I will crush you and your |PLAYER_WARFRAME| Warframe!

Should we do introductions? I am |ENEMY_NAME|. My |ENEMY_WEAPON| is looking forward to meeting you.

What is this? |CLAN_NAME|? |CLAN_NAMEB|? I should have known the The Tenno clans were uniting!

You hide behind that |PLAYER_WARFRAME| Warframe. Face me like a true warrior!

You just signed your death warrant, |PLAYER_NAME|.

You call yourself a Warrior? Show some honor.

Your |PLAYER_WEAPON| isn't nearly powerful enough to defeat me!

You call that skill? Clan |CLAN_NAME| should be ashamed.

We tire of failure. Who put their faith in you Admiral.
------
You did. I have a life debt.
------
To be paid in Tenno blood.
------
I understand.
------
Do not awaken the vipers. Do not study them. Crush these eggs before they hatch. This we command.
------
My Queens... Hu rrhus okey. 
------
You are approaching the holding area. Careful, if the wardens detect you they will surely initiate the execution sequence.
------
Execution sequence initiated. Get the hostage out of there before it's too late.
------
Hurry up, you are running out of time.
------
The hostage is almost out of time. Hurry.
------
They killed the hostage. This mission is a failure.
------
You let the hostage die. This mission is over.
------
We have located the enemy's planetary communication towers. Capture the towers and remain in control long enough to decode incoming messages.
------
These radio towers carry top secret interplanetary communications. You are going to capture the towers and decode incoming messages.
------
Nearby communications towers are broadcasting crucial enemy intelligence. Capture the towers and decode any incoming messages. 
------
We need to find out where the Fomorian Power Cores are being produced, intercept Grineer messages so that we may determine the facility's location.
------
You are here to intercept critical information about the location of the Fomorian Power Cores. 
------
The enemy will stop to capture this intel before we do. We cannot let that happen.
------
The enemy has adapted to our ability to intercept their communications from space. Using these new communications towers means that messages cannot be intercepted anywhere but at their destination.
------
These towers are used for encoding two way communications between planets. The more towers we control, the faster we can intercept the message.
------
The Grineer are communicating using a highly sophisticated deep encryption algorithm. We can crack it but we need as many message fragments as possible.
------
Try and capture another signal. Be careful though, the enemy has surely rallied stronger reinforcements.
------
I have detected another incoming message. Capture and decode the signal.
------
They are broadcasting another message, make sure the enemy never receives it.
------
The data you have collected here today will go a long way in supporting our cause. 
------
Good work today. Not only have we decoded the enemy transmissions, we have also disrupted their communications. 
------
The message fragments you collected here today will go along way toward locating the Fomorian cores.
------
The enemy have captured the message. We have failed today.
------
The enemy have decoded the message. You have failed in your mission.
------
Tower online. 
------
Tower captured, beginning stream decode now.
------
You have captured a radio tower.
------
This tower is ours now.
------
Tower lost.
------
The enemy have captured a tower.
------
We have lost control of a tower.
------
The enemy have taken a tower, you must recapture it.
------
We are in total control. Keep fighting.
------
We have control of all four towers.
------
We are dominating, keep it up.
------
The enemy is dominating, you must capture a tower, and quickly.
------
The enemy has all four towers. You must stop them.
------
The enemy have deployed fierce reinforcements, are you willing to stay and decode more messages?
------
Still more data is being broadcasted. Are you willing to risk going back into the field?
------
Extraction is available but there are more messages to be decoded. Will you stay or go?
------
We have successfully decoded the message. Clear the area.
------
We have the decoded the message. The remaining enemies must not report back to their command. Eliminate everyone. 
------
Message decoded. Leave none alive. Clear out the remaining enemy forces.
------
We cannot allow the enemy to learn of our espionage. Eliminate the remaining enemy personnel.
------
It's the Tenno.
------
No, no. Not you.
------
What? Guards! Tenno! 
------
They've come for me.
------
I'm out of here.
------
Not going to happen.
------
I must escape!
------
Shit. Tenno.
------
I'm too important to die.
------
Keep the betrayers off my back
------
Stop them
------
You will not capture me
------
Don't let them get me.
------
Stop them.
------
Keep them away
------
Kill them
------
Do you ever stop?
------
No...stay away.
------
Prisoner? Never!
------
Fight to the death 
------
Not going out like this.
------
You won't take me...
------
Stay back.
------
No, no. I'll pay you anything!
------
Who sent you, what do they want?
------
Grineer will stop you.
------
You've got the wrong person.
------
I don't know anything.
------
This will not go unpunished.
------
Death for Grineer

------
Tenno, you made it! I'm on the other side of the complex. They have these new prototypes but don't you worry... I shut them down remotely. You will just have to deal with the regular security.
------
You know, some people just can't take no for an answer. I just want to do my own thing. The family business is well and good, but not for me. You know?
------
You! You have no place here, Tenno. Darvo, is this your doing?
------
Nothing personal father, it never has been. I only work for myself. I make my own profits. You of all people should understand this.
------
You belong here, Darvo. There is no other option.
------
Let me tell you, Tenno. It's a good thing I was able to shutdown the new Hyena models. This year's version is really nasty business. Faster, meaner, deadlier than before. An excellent product really. I wouldn't want you to have to deal with... ooh... wait, wait... My codes, my codes! They have been overridden. 
------
Let me tell you, Tenno. It's a good thing I was able to shutdown the new Hyena models. This year's version is really nasty business. Faster, meaner, deadlier than before. An excellent product really.
------
Ooh... wait, wait... My codes, my codes! They have been overridden. 
------
This is a family matter, Tenno. You will not interfere.
------
So Tenno, looks like those new Hyena models are back online. Forget everything I said before. This is nothing you can't handle, right! Right?
------
So Tenno, looks like those new Hyena models are back online.
------
Forget everything I said before. This is nothing you can't handle, right! Right?
------
Darvo, you disappoint me yet again.
------
Damn it Father, I am almost a hundred and five years old. I make my own choices.
------
Nobody chooses to turn down a Seat on the Board. You were groomed from a young age. Sacrifices were made in your name, and this is how you repay your debt?
------
I am really sorry you had to witness this, Tenno.
------
Darvo, we are backed into a corner. Project Tethra will be the deathblow! You are needed here. What have these betrayers ever done for you?
------
You did it. I knew you could handle those Hyenas. Now come get me.
------
I'm in one of these cells. Hurry up, I can't wait to get out of here.
------
Let's get to extraction and fast before he sends in reinforcements. My father is scary when he gets angry.
------
I will not forget your transgressions here today, Tenno.
------
Here we go. Are you ready? I'm ready. Take that data mass and drop it into the system, I'll be able to hack into the ship remotely once you do. Should be easy, you'll find what I need in no time.
------
Just so you know. I'm a bit new to this whole guide thing, so it's not going to be like the Lotus. Don't worry everything will be just fine.
------
I think you're near the terminal. Yes, yes you are. Drop me in and I'll get to work.
------
You're close, drop me in. 
------
Did you hear something strange? No, okay I'll keep going, nearly done. 
------
Just making a few more adjustments. Nothing strange going on down there? Just corpus defenses? Nothing...else? 
------
There you are. Thought you could hunt me, well look who I brought. The Tenno.
------
That's it. hmm... I didn't find what I needed. Go to the next terminal. It should be there. I think.
------
I'm really sorry about this Tenno but you need to go to the third terminal. I just can't seem find what I'm looking for here.
------
Here we are. The last one. I'm going to try one more thing to see if I can't lure... I mean find...the target. 
------
You did it, you took care of my problem. That freak's been tailing me for months. That's a load off my back. I'm so relieved.
------
Go on, get to extraction.
------
Well that didn't work out as planned. Looks like I'm gonna need to find some more Tenno.
------
That's not good for business. That's not good for anyone.
------
You are here to find anything that can be used to neutralize the toxin. Take out any Grineer you encounter along the way.
------
This is a recon mission. You are looking for key ingredients that can be used to build an antidote to the Grineer toxin. Destroy any resistance you encounter on your mission.
------
My research indicates everything we need to neutralize the toxin is located in this forest. Find the key ingredients and wipe out any resistance you see along the way.
------
My scans indicate the chemical compounds we are looking for are in your vicinity. Use your scanner to locate them.
------
Your scanner should be able to reveal the chemical compounds we are looking for. 
------
Keep searching. This forests holds the key ingredients we need to neutralize the Grineer toxin.
------
The vegatation in this forest grows too fast and too big for even the Grineer to cut down. Instead they have opted to poison the land. We must stop them. 
------
Rather than trying to live within the forest, the Grineer have opted to destroy it. You must not let this happen.
------
I'm detecting no more Grineer in the area. When you are done searching for ingredients, get to extraction.
------
Good. That is one of the chemicals we are looking for. Find as many as you can and then head to the foundry to craft an anti-toxin.
------
Excellent find. See if you can locate any more samples. When you are done the anti-toxin can be produced in the foundry.
------
See that? That's how the Grineer plan to inject the toxin into the biosphere. When we have the anti-toxin, that is where it goes.
------
Those Toxin injectors are how the Grineer plan on delivering their payload. That is what we are here to neutralize.
------
You brought an anti-toxin. Find the Injector and neutralize the poison.
------
The Grineer are attempting to clear this forest by poisoning the soil. Find their toxin injectors and sabotage their efforts.
------
I see you have an anti-toxin with you, good, we can use it setback Grineer efforts even further. Find the injector and neutralize the poison.
------
You have reached the target. Administer the anti-toxin.
------
You found the poison. Place the anti-toxin in the injector.
------
You have found the poison, now sabotage the Grineer injector.
------
Neutralizing the Grineer toxin is the only way to save these forests.
------
Our attack would be even more effective if we could figure out a way to neutralize the Grineer toxin. 
------
That anti-toxin you brought is going to put a serious dent in Grineer deforestation efforts. 
------
I see you crafted a very potent anti-toxin. It will remain effective for much longer. Be prepared for a lengthy fight.
------
It's in. Now defend the injector while the anti-toxin works to neutralize the poison. 
------
Ready? Keep the Grineer at bay while the anti-toxin does it's work.
------
The injector is now in an unstable overdrive. Keep the Grineer away while it melts down. 
------
We are going to destroy the injector by operating it a dangerously high velocity. Keep the Grineer at bay until it melts down.
------
Good work, the Grineer toxin is losing strength. Get to extraction. This fight is far from over, craft more potent anti-toxins to have an even bigger impact.
------
Your payload has been delivered. It's time for extraction. Craft stronger anti-toxins to have an even bigger impact on the Grineer poison. 
------
That was a strong anti-toxin, the Grineer will not last long at this rate. Get to extraction.
------
Impressive, your antidote has set back Grineer efforts considerably. Time to go home.
------
Mastery of Earth is Grineer destiny. Our Queens command it.
------
The Cicero Toxin will bring Grineer order to the land. 
------
We deserve more than a cold dark asteroid! Earth for the Grineer. Earth for our Queens!
------
These trees, these genetically modified Orokin monstrosities must wither and die.
------
Grineer brothers! It is us or the Orokin weeds and we must choose herb-a-cide!
------
The garden of earth is overgrown. Who will help me reap this victory from this land?
------
Brothers, don't trust any plant you can't rip apart with your bare hands.
------
Earth is for settlements, settlements, settlements!
------
Grineer order will conquer the land. Grineer order will conquer Earth.
------
The Cicero Toxin will cleanse the land. Leaving a glorious home for our Queens.
------
Nothing can stop the Grineer. We ARE progress.
------
Just like these weeds, the Tenno are nothing more than a mistake grown in the bottom of some dirty Orokin test tube.
------
Tenno hate Grineer strength. They want to tear down anything they are too weak to build for themselves.
------
Tenno are worse than the weeds. We kill one and three more show up.
------
We clear this land in the name of Grineer and our Queens.
------
Down with Orokin weeds! Down with the Tenno!
------
Tenno bones will be the foundation of Grineer homes!
------
Death, death, death. Death to the Tenno.
------
No mercy for Tenno. No mercy for their Lotus.
------
The Lotus is just another weed to be plucked and discarded.
------
Our Queens demand justice for your trespasses, Tenno.
------
The Tenno hate our superiority. We will put them out of their jealous misery.
------
Stop them. Defend the Cicero Toxin
------
Protect the Cicero toxin. Stop the Tenno.
------
Tenno crimes require Grineer sacrifice. Protect the Cicero Toxin at all costs.
------
The Tenno have come to destroy our way of life. Stop them at all costs.
------
Brothers. Do not let The Tenno threaten our destiny. 
------
Prepare the Cicero toxin for injection.
------
Brothers. Proceed with the culling. Rot the weeds from the inside.
------
Proceed with the injections. Our Queens command punctuality.
------
Let there be no more delays. Inject the Cicero toxin. Unlock the future.
------
No. No, you will not stop this. 
------
Only a small setback, insignificant against the tide of Grineer will.
------
Tenno, you are only delaying the inevitable.
------
The Fomorian cores are the lynch pin of total domination.
------
When we are done the Fomorian ships will blacken the sun.
------
Corpus ingenuity is no match for Grineer audacity.
------
Fomorians will crush, crush, crush anything in our way.
------
Be proud. You are building the future.
------
Tenno! Tenno! Tenno! You think you are winning? You have only been attacking the auxiliary cores!  Did you really believe it would be this easy?!
------
You have taken my bait but you will not take my cores. Grineer ATTACK!!!
------
You have already shown me your hand. Now it is time to see what I have up my sleeve.
------
Try it Tenno. Just try and walk out of here with the core.
------
You are running out of time. There will be nowhere to hide from my Fomorians. And when the last of you is gone I will personally throw your beloved Lotus INTO THE SUN.
------
What is happening? Where? Where is the core? 
------
Something is wrong. Tenno?!? Stop them!
------
What is happening to the Tram? Investigate. Investigate now!
------
Come back with the core. Or don't come back at all!
------
Be warned. Failure to stop the Tenno will result in your failure to continue breathing.
------
Stop them. Recover the cores. 
------
Tenno, Tenno, Tenno are here. Stop them. Stop them at once!
------
Tenno have the core. They are not permitted to have the core.
------
Assassins, thieves, miscreants. Leave my cores alone.
------
You are only delaying the inevitable. My Fomorians will be built. My ships will rule the system.
------
We will build the cores faster than you can destroy them Tenno. Mark my words!
------
You can not stop progress. All will be Grineer dominion.
------
Thank you Tenno. It should be a long time before we hear Vay Hek's ugly voice again. Now get to extraction, you have earned it.

------
This is too easy. Tell your Lotus to send more capable fighters next time.
------
You are not ready for this fight.
------
Tenno. What makes you think you are ready to fight Vay Hek?
------
The first Grineer who brings me the head of a Tenno will be permitted to wear its skull as a helmet.
------
Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill the Tenno scum.
------
Your Lotus is leading you to destruction.
------
You Tenno are such a waste of good violence.
------
Councillor Vay Hek rose to power by 'eliminating' his enemies on the Grineer council. He now has near complete control which makes him one of the most influential Grineer.
------
Vay Hek's plans for complete system domination make him too dangerous. You know what to do.
------
Our operatives tell us Vay Hek has undergone an expensive regime of combat enhancement. Expect the worst.
------
I knew this day would come. I've prepared, changed myself. I've made sacrifices.  Tenno, Are you ready for a sacrifice?
------
These criminals think they are commiting a justice.  Not in my court.
------
Why are these fools still breathing my air? This is unacceptable.
------
Must I do everything myself.
------
Now we finish this business. Once and for all.
------
Grineer Brothers. I've done my part, now clean up this mess.
------
I am too important for this nonsense. Finish them off. 
------
Do not think we are done here Tenno.
------
Nothing can stop the Grineer.  We are progress.
------
Tenno hate Grineer strength.  They want to tear down anything they are too weak to build for themselves.
------
Death! Death! Death! Death to the Tenno!
------
No mercy for Tenno.  No mercy for their Lotus.
------
Our Queens demand justice for your trespasses, Tenno.
------
The Tenno hate our superiority.  We will put them out of their jealous misery.
------
The Tenno are nothing but an obstacle on the path to victory. Crush this obstacle.
------
Tenno are the cancer of greatness. 
------
Tenno are tyrants, tearing down all who dare to stand tall. Only the Grineer can end Tenno tyranny.
------
These theives would deny us the spoils of our strength? Brothers, will you let them take what is rightfully yours?
------
These Tenno used to be ghosts of history. Let us make them ghosts once again.
------
Tenno are scavengers. Surviving on our scraps.

Thank you for your service, Brother.
------
Look what these Tenno made me do.
------
This one fullfills his duty with honor.
------
This one honors the Grineer with his sacrifice.
------
A sacrifice worthy of a warrior.
------
Crush them.
------
You. Hurt Tenno.
------
Now, take your glory Brother.
------
This is an honor.
------
Use this gift Brother.
------
This will make you see the light.
------
 I knew I could count on your support Tenno.
------
Finally, a use for these theives.
------
CO-OPERATE!
------
Betray!
------
Ahhh!!! Curse you Tenno. You got me!
------
There is only one truth in politics: evolve or die. I have evolved. You must die.
------
Ahhh!!! Engines failing... ah. Curse you, curse you Tenno. You got me. You got me! 
------
Tenno, stand... something is happening. 
------
These readings, this should not be possible. Tenno, my sensors are... 
------
Tenno,  listen carefully you are being hunted by ... Abort the mission... Get to extraction ...
------
Do not try to stay and fight... They will kill you...
------
Get away now. You do not want...
------
The... has been designed.... fight and kill Tenno... Do not risk...
------
We lost Tenno today but you made it out.
------
We left Tenno behind today but you are safe.
------
The mission was scapped but everyone made it out. That is what matters.
------
Even though the mission was aborted, you are all safe. That means we won today.
------
The Grustrag Three have been eliminated. Impressive but Tenno, next time follow my orders.
------
That was the last of the Grustrag Three, you took a risk but it paid off.
------
Tenno, do you read. Tenno come in. Tenno...
------
Running scared. Running weak.
------
Rats run. Warriors fight.
------
Turning to flea. Predicatable.
------
I knew they would run. What a waste of time!
------
I like how |PLAYER_NAME| smells.
------
I'm going to play with this one.
------
|PLAYER_NAME| is the scrawniest of them all.
------
Is |PLAYER_NAME| the best they have?
------
Shiny little pretty things you Tenno are.
------
 Is one of them wearing a scarf?
------
You are beneath us.
------
Are we sure these are the targets? They seem so inconsequential.
------
Do not waste my time Tenno.
------
Boring!
------
|PLAYER_NAME| your |PLAYER_WARFRAME| looks so...slippery.
------
I want to play with these ones.
------
This one is mine.
------
Starting capture.
------
Too easy.
------
Pathetic.
------
Wait to you see what comes next...
------
Did you know, this is my favourite part?
------
Tenno captured.
------
Target retrieved.
------
An easy capture.
------
Captured.
------
Time for the fun.
------
This one is all mine now.
------
Unacceptable.
------
That one will be difficult to replace.
------
You are going to suffer for that Tenno.
------
The newest entry into the Corpus AI security arsenal is a deadly biped dubbed Ambulas. We have tracked the prototype to this ship. Locate and eliminate it.
------
Obliterate the prototype. We need to be certain it does not make it to the manufacturing stage.
------
Destroying Ambulas will be a blow to Corpus robotics research. Stay the course.
------
Ambulas possess a devastating kick for those who get too close. Long range attacks are advisable.
------
Corpus robotics technology is reaching grave proportions. Destroying this archetype is imperative.
------
Ambulas likes to play with fire. Try not to get burned.
------
I've detected a Blast Door guarding the target. Install a bypass on the controls.
------
There's a Blast Door in the way. Patch me in on the Control Panel and I'll take care of it.
------
Protect the relay. Running system bypass.
------
Okay, I'm in. Hold this position while I bypass the system controls.
------
Bypass complete. You may proceed.
------
The bypass is done. Go!
------
That was easy. Keep moving.
------
Alarms have been reset.
------
Alarms succesfully hacked, the ship is returning to normal security levels.
------
Alarms reset, they do not suspect a thing.
------
Corpus Walkers are heading to your location.
------
We've got robots inbound.
------
Walkers incoming.
------
Looks like heavy activity ahead.
------
Heavy robotics signature detected. Lock and load.
------
I'm detecting a large security force heading your way... it's the Gri...no wait, it's the Corpus. Definitely the Corpus.
------
More coming your way.
------
Here comes trouble. A Corpus Jackal is in your sector.
------
Brace yourselves. A Jackal has been detected in your area.
------
Here comes trouble. A Corpus Quadruped is in your sector.
------
Brace yourselves. A Corpus Quadruped has been detected in your area.
------
Warning. I have detected Drone robotics.
------
They're deploying Drone robotics. Be careful.
------
Heads up. A Grineer assault team is headed your way.
------
I'm detecting a large security force heading your way. It's the Grineer.
------
Marines inbound.
------
Watch yourself, foot soldiers are on the way.
------
You are surrounded by Grineer Marines.
------
Warning: Heavy Grineer Approaching.
------
Stay focused, there's a Heavy Unit approaching.
------
Multiple bio-signatures detected, we've got Infested incoming.
------
Heavy infestation ahead. Get ready.
------
Multiple targets ahead. Leave no one standing.
------
I am picking up strange energy fluctuations in the area, remain vigilant.
------
This is unexpected, our enemy... not operate on these fre...
------
I'm unable to... Tenno, change of... 
------
Tenno... You are... DANGER.  Something else... Something... powerful.
------
Keep moving. None of the scanners have detected you.
------
You're still in the clear. No detection from enemy sensors.
------
Keep going. No body knows you're here.
------
Keep going. No body knows you're on this ship.
------
You're on the sensors now. You've been detected.
------
They spotted you. Get ready for a fight.
------
You've been seen. Ready your weapon.
------
Wow, they are not happy about you being here. 
------
Looks like you're on the systems now. So watch out.
------
The cryogenics core has malfunctioned. Expect colder-than-normal temperatures. 
------
I've detected freezing temperatures. The ice in here will damage your shields.
------
I'm detecting ice... lots of it. Be cautious, your shields will take a hit from the cold.
------
This area has taken some hits. Stay away from fire damage.
------
Stay away from the fire.
------
Ammunition storage has become volatile. Rounds are combusting everywhere. Stay away from the fire.
------
Ship is entering lock down. We'll need to override the system.
------
Doors are locked. Time to break in.
------
We've been locked out. Let's override the security.
------
Did they lock you out? That's cute. 
------
Be aware. Sandstorms in the area are going to cut your visibility significantly.
------
Look out Tenno, their is a sandstorm blowing through. Visibility will be minimal.
------
The enemy won't be the only thing you have to contend with, a sandstorm just blew in.
------
Breach complete. We're free to proceed. 
------
Override complete. Move on.
------
Override successful. Let's get going. 
------
That was easy. Keep moving.
------
Recent innovations in Corpus robotics have lead to a surge in production. Their newest animal-like proxy is an unrelenting hunter. Codenamed "Hyena", this robot is designed to work in packs.
------
Our operatives have identified at least four different variations of the Hyena model, each with a different specialization and arsenal of attacks.
------
Use caution, the Hyena pack will work together to try and take you down. 
------
In an attempt to exert power and authority, the Corpus recently introduced their most lethal security proxy yet. Determine its location aboard this vessel and destroy it.
------
Nicknamed "The Jackal," this is the same deadly quad-robot which has become extremely problematic for our cells in the field.
------
Do not dismiss the The Jackal as just another Corpus proxy. This will be unlike any enemy you have faced yet.
------
Sergeant Nef Anyo oversees operations of the Solar Rails in this district. Intelligence reports indicate that Anyo has been using the rails to acquire recovered cryo-pods containing dormant Warframes. Kill him and save your fellow Tenno.
------
Anyo is stockpiling the pods and selling them to the highest bidders. His clientele includes rogue scientists and splinter groups with nefarious intentions.
------
Eliminate Anyo. When the job is finished we will send in a clean-up team to recover the pods.
------
Anyo's self-interests are a threat to our ongoing operations. He must be removed immediately.
------
Anyo's venture has afforded him the best in Corpus security robotics. Eliminate anything that moves.
------
Anyo has too much at stake. He will fight to the death.
------
We cannot allow the Warframes to fall into the wrong hands. Taking Anyo out is imperative.
------
Security has tightened in this section. You are nearing Anyo's position.
------
Anyo is aware of your presence. Get the jump on him.
------
Director of the Sol Council, Vay Hek is entrusted with settling diplomatic disputes between various races of the Solar System. He abused this power with the premeditated murder of several political opponents. His appointment is dangerous to our continued efforts.
------
Hek travels with a formidable security force. Getting close to him will prove difficult.
------
Intel suggests Hek is planning to add to his list of departed adversaries, including several of our own. Take him out.
------
Security is getting heavier. Hek must be close.
------
Killing Hek will bring much needed stability to this sector.
------
Hek has made many enemies. Eliminating him could gain us favor with the council.
------
You have Hek insight. Stay alert, and stay alive!
------
Hek is notoriously unpredictable. Be prepared for anything.
------
If Hek is allowed to live there could be drastic repercussions for the entire system. Take him down. There is no other option.
------
Lieutenant Lech Kril has been implicated in a Grineer plot to annihilate one of our remote colonies in this sector. The plan is to alter the course of a rogue asteroid which will put the colony directly in the planetoid's path. Locate and eliminate Kril.
------
Kril is a seasoned war hero with many battles under his belt. His victories are decided by his trusty hammer. One which he wields with brutal consequences.
------
Kril is highly unpredictable. We suspect he may have other tricks up his sleeve. To survive this battle, you must strike hard and fast.
------
You are nearing Kril's location. Proceed with caution.
------
Kril is aware of your presence. Strike first!
------
Eliminating Kril is the only chance for our exposed colony.
------
Grineer researcher Tyl Regor has made alarming strides in the field of gene repair. His work would not only reverse centuries of deterioration due to excessive cloning but also allow for stronger and deadlier genetic moulds. Eliminate Regor and put a stop to his work.
------
The Corpus have locked the Grineer into financial dependence for grafts and antidotes to slow physical deterioration. We need to ensure that the Corpus continue to control this.
------
Regor is aware of your presence. Bring him down quickly.
------
Regor will fight to the death to see this project through. We cannot let that happen. Silence his work.
------
The only thing standing between the Grineer and total power is their continuous state of genetic deterioration. It's one of the few natural balances in this conflict. Regor's work would destroy this balance.
------
Expect Regor to be armed with the best in Grineer weapons and defense capabilities.
------
Regor's grunts are in full force. He must be close.
------
Unfortunately Regor's brilliance is overshadowed by his complete lack of ethics. His work is a threat to the entire system. He must be terminated.
------
General Sargas Ruk has become a problem for our artifact recovery efforts. Several of our dig sites in this sector have been attacked and annexed by Ruk and his fleet. Take Ruk out.
------
Ruk sees flesh as a flaw. As a result, he has built a profitable artifact smuggling outfit to finance his search for the best in Grineer body modifications and augmentations.
------
Ruk is nearby. Be warned that he is a formidable adversary, with an almost inhuman hatred for all that is not Grineer.
------
Ruk is the Grineer's preeminent artifact hunter. Taking him out will cripple their artifact recovery efforts.
------
Ruk will be adorning only the most impressive in Grineer body modifications. You will need to stay one step ahead of him.
------
Eliminating Ruk will allow us to regain control of this system.
------
Captain Vor has lived under suspicion of possessing Orokin technology that grants him powerful abilities. We cannot allow this. Get to his location and eliminate him.
------
Further intel suggests that Vor acquired his abilities while working recovery missions for the fleet as a freighter hand. 
------
You are nearing Vor's position. Be prepared for a violent battle.
------
This ship is crawling with grunts. Getting to Vor will prove difficult.
------
Vor's reputation precedes him. Taking him down will be a favor to the entire system.
------
Vor is feared across the system. Do not underestimate him.
------
We believe Vor has the ability to teleport. You will need to watch your back.
------
Vor has a tendency to play with his prey. Do not let yourself become distracted by this tactic.
------
Kela de Thaym holds a position of influence in the Grineer Court. Eliminating Kela should create a power vacuum  inside the Grineer leadership and weaken Grineer influence in this system.
------
Kela is a product of the Sisters. She is built for combat. Much of her body has been replaced with combat augmentations. Approach her with caution.
------
I'm detecting a bio-mechanical signature nearby. Be ready for anything. 
------
Intel suggests Kela is armed with explosive weaponry, her personal modification of the Bombard design. Take any necessary precautions to ensure this mission's success.
------
Kela keeps an entourage of highly-trained Grineer marines with her. We suspect that they are as much for her entertainment as they are for protection.
------
All Grineer females undergo mandatory military training. Kela in particular revels in combat. She extended her term for more than a decade before returning to the Court. Do not underestimate her.
------
One of our spy cells has been lost investigating this abandoned Grineer asteroid base. We need you to locate and eliminate whatever is responsible.
------
This place is crawling with Infested. Unfortunately, something far more ominous awaits. Make your way deeper into the base.
------
Your target is an aberration of twisted flesh. Put the thing out of its misery.
------
Avoid the creature's spine-strike. These razor-sharp quills will rip your Warframe to shreds.
------
The creature is incredibly agile for a deformed quadruped. Keep moving to avoid being crushed.
------
Listen for its screams. This will mean you are getting close.
------
Elude its bone-chilling shrieks if you wish to stay alive.
------
The destruction of the Ambulas biped prototype has halted Corpus production plans for this latest model. We hope it is the only of its kind out there.
------
The death of Arn Etina means the Corpus mineral pipeline has been severed. Robotics production will be disrupted for weeks.
------
Those Hyena's were the most advanced proxies we've seen yet. The Corpus are making unsettling progress towards total technological superiority. We must monitor them closely.
------
Seeing the Jackal in action is grim. It's clear the Corpus are capable of producing robotics beyond what we imagined.
------
The death of Sergeant Ned Anyo should weaken the Corpus Research and Development operations for quite sometime.
------
The defeat of Grineer Captain Vor opens up other regions for the Tenno.
------
The death of Counselor Vay Hek will bring all Grineer deployments to a halt.
------
Eliminating a Grineer General will render the Saturn region helplessly unorganized.
------
The death of revered War Hero, Lech Kril will undoubtedly send shockwaves throughout Grineer society. The silencing of his hammer will bring security to this system, but we have potentially created a martyr in Kril.
------
Tyl Regor was no ordinary Grineer. He was the leader in cloning reproduction, known as C.R. The self-proclaimed Father of Future Grineer, his death will weaken the future production of soldiers.
------
That Golem was the most complex species of infested we've encountered. Their ability to overtake multiple species is growing.
------
Infested encounters are beginning to reach nightmare-like proportions. This latest abomination proves that there is no limit to the imagination when dealing with these monsters.
------
You've opened an Orokin Vault. It appears unaffected by the Infestation.
------
A pristine Orokin Vault... curious.
------
You've unlocked an Orokin Vault. Its... clean.
------
You have the Vault artifact, let's go.
------
You've got it. Something is different about this artifact...
------
Vault artifact acquired. You'll need to extract before we can verify its function.
------
The artifact you are carrying appears to be affecting your Warframe.
------
Until we get you to extraction, that artifact will continue to affect your Warframe.
------
Your Warframe is being impaired by the artifact.
------
It appears that you've triggered security. The Corrupted are here.
------
Looks like some Corrupted stayed behind to guard the artifact, it must be valuable.
------
The Corrupted will stop at nothing to prevent  that artifact from escaping. This won't be easy.
------
Something's wrong...
------
I am the Lotus. I will guide you but we must hurry, Vor is coming for you. I see that the cryo-sleep has taken your memory. It does not matter. You are Tenno, I will prepare you.
------
I see that the cryo-sleep has taken your memory. It does not matter. You are Tenno, I will prepare you.
------
I will test you.
------
A Warframe shows your vital statistics. This shows your health.
------
This may hurt.
------
The cryo pod has left you in a weakened state. 
------
Your health does not recharge. Touch this healing sphere before we continue.
------
Now, I have engaged your shields. Shields absorb damage before health is affected.
------
Notice how the shields will recharge.
------
I will show you the Tenno fighting system. It has three forms. The first is your blade. A Tenno's melee weapon is always with them, always at the ready. 
------
Cut down this target.
Hold <NEXT_INV> to draw or sheath your melee weapon. 
Tap <MELEE> when you blade is drawn to strike.
------
This display shows the clip size and the total ammo you have.
------
Find ammo on dead enemies and in the environment.
------
Take the ammo and reload your weapon.
Press <RELOAD> to reload.
------
Excellent, the second form is your primary weapon.
------
Destroy these targets.
Press <PRE_ATTACK> to shoot.
Hold <AIM_WEAPON> to aim.
------
Well done. Do you see the indicator below your weapon and Warframe? This is affinity.
------
You increase affinity during combat, and in missions to come. Increase your affinity to unlock the power of your arsenal.
------
Your third and final form is your secondary weapon. Switch weapons now.
Use <NEXT_INV> to switch weapons.
------
Destroy this target with your blade.
Hold <NEXT_INV> to draw or sheath your melee weapon. 
Tap <MELEE> when you blade is drawn to strike.
------
A Tenno must use these forms in combination to destroy their enemies.
------
Attack these targets using blade and gun.
------
Excellent. As you level, you receive points to customize your weapons and unlock Warframe powers. I will unlock a power now to demonstrate its use.
------
Power consumes energy. Absorb this energy sphere.
------
Now, unleash your power on this target.
Use <ACTIVATE_ABILITY_0> to activate the first power.
------
We can't afford to waste anymore time. You must get to extraction before Vor finds you. Hurry, Tenno.
------
He dropped a mod. Quickly pick it up, it will come in handy later.
------
We can't afford to waste any more time. I have unscrambled the portal. Get out of here. As fast as you can, run.
Hold <PRE_RUN> to sprint.
------
I've engaged your map system. Locate your objective.
------
Prove you are worthy to join us. Destroy the targets before time runs out.
------
Excellent, you have attained the rank of Initiate.
------
You have failed my test. Return here tomorrow, if you wish to try again.
------
I await your return when you have learned more. Farewell.
------
I am the Lotus, friend and guide. I see that the cryo-sleep has taken your memory. It does not matter. You are Tenno, I will prepare you.
------
The bridge is in ruins. Tenno, you are a master of movement, traverse this gap.
------
Follow this example. Jump against the wall and hold your jump as you run across.
Use <JUMP> to jump then hold <JUMP> to wallrun
------
There is no more time. Work on traversal when you have fully recovered. For now, just run.
------
Vor, is close. Get out of there now!
------
This is the upgrade interface. Here you will equip upgrades called 'MODS' on items in your Arsenal
------
MODS can be found by killing enemies and completing missions. These are crucial to maximizing your power and expanding your tactics. There are hundreds of MOD types.
------
Installing MODs is limited by your item's MOD capacity. Increase an item's MOD capacity by ranking it up. Super-charging it with Orokin technology will double this capacity.
------
Each MOD has a set of attributes. The description indicates its benefits. This shows which type of item it is compatible with. This shows the capacity cost to install this MOD.
------
This symbol indicates the MODS polarity. An item will have some slots polarized. Matching polarity will make a MOD cheaper to install. A clashing polarity will increase the cost.
------
Remember - if you see this indicator flashing - if means your MOD capacity is not high enough to install. Check your polarities, rank up your gear and super-charge to increase your capacity.
------
That is all for now. Finding and installing MODs is crucial to realizing your Arsenals potential.
------
The Raptor is the most recent Corpus heavy weapon. You must destroy it before they can begin full scale production.
------
It's done. Thanks to you the Raptor won't be entering full production any time soon. Get to extraction.
------
Welcome Tenno, are you ready to prove yourself?
------
Have you come here to prove your worth?
------
Welcome to the dojo, you have much to prove.
------
Welcome Tenno, you have much to prove.
------
A challenger has entered the dojo.
------
Another Tenno seeks battle, are you ready?
------
Another challenger has arrived.
------
Is this opponent worthy?
------
Will you accept this challenge?
------
It's time to issue your challenge.
------
Are they worthy?
------
A challenger has left the dojo.
------
A challenger has left.
------
Tenno, ready yourselves.
------
May the best fighter win.
------
Begin!
------
May the best fighters win.
------
Well done.
------
Impressive.
------
You fight well Tenno.
------
This isn't over yet.
------
Focus yourself.
------
This is the final round.
------
You are a worthy fighter but you must always stay vigilant.
------
Very good Tenno, you have defeated the challenger.
------
Excellent - you have defeated your challenger.
------
You are a strong fighter, our enemies have much to fear.
------
You win.
------
You have much to learn.
------
You have lost. Perhaps more training is in order.
------
You are in need of practice Tenno.
------
You have lost Tenno.
------
Careful Tenno, the ground beneath you is crumbling. Can you defeat these enemies before you have nowhere left to stand?
------
Your Warframe's movement abilities are key to this challenge. Defeat all the enemies before the ground completely falls away.
------
Your foes are not the only dangers you will face in the field. Avoid the lasers and defeat the enemies before the timer runs out.
------
How well do you shoot under pressure? You must traverse this space before the timer runs out. Shooting the targets will buy you extra time.
------
A full frontal attack is not always the best option. Using your stealth abilities eliminate all enemies without being detected.
------
This will be your hardest test yet. Defeat all incoming enemies.
------
Show me you are capable of fighting on multiple fronts. Capture and hold more points than the enemy to succeed.
------
Let's see how you work under pressure. Eliminate all enemies before the timer reaches zero. Melee strike the orbs to have extra seconds added to the clock.
------
Tenno, you are but one against the hoard. Your survival depends on speed. Go.
------
You show promise. Alas, this is just the beginning.
------
Our enemies are innumerable. There is no time for rest.
------
You have passed this test. Tenno, you give me hope that honor and balance may one day be returned to our system.
------
A Tenno must be a master of all their weapons. Prove yourself with you primary weapon.
------
I believe you can handle more.
------
Prove your ability with a sidearm. Eliminate all targets.
------
Show me that you know of the old ways. Eliminate all targets using your melee weapon.
------
You have proven your skills with weapons, Tenno but what of your endurance? Can you survive this onslaught?
------
Tenno are more than just fighters. Prove your intellect by hacking these terminals.
------
Time to test your marksmanship. Track and shoot all targets.
------
Your Warframe is a weapon. Prove you have mastered it's power.
------
Now we will test your agility. Shoot the targets to create your path.
------
Ready yourself.
------
Again.
------
Excellent. Continue.
------
Most disappointing. Only return when you are ready for this challenge.
------
It appears you need more practice, Tenno. This challenge awaits you when you are ready.
------
A formidable performance. This test is now complete

------
The Tenno have gained great strength thanks to you, Grandmaster.
------
The Lotus is pleased to be in the presence of a Grandmaster.
------
We are in your debt Grandmaster, thank you.
------
With your support Grandmaster, the Tenno will rise again.
------
Now the Tenno are stronger by your hand Grandmaster.
------
These cards represent the artifacts of the Orokin War. Each provides unique boosts to you and your teammates during missions.
------
Each player can choose an artifact from their collection, before the mission begins.
------
These artifacts give a small Tenno squad an edge against their vast enemies.
------
This is the Foundry. Here you will build powerful new items to expand your arsenal.
------
To build an item requires a blueprint and its components. While there are blueprints in the market, most are hidden throughout the system.
------
Search ships and defeat enemies to obtain components. The components found are influenced by the region of space you are in.
------
The Foundry is key to owning the most powerful weapons and artifacts that exist.
------
You control how I connect you with other Tenno agents. You may freely join other agents, restrict it to your contacts or go it alone.
------
Welcome Tenno. This is the Origin System, and you are its ward.
------
Our enemies control the ancient Solar Rail Network and with it, travel throughout the regions. Complete missions to regain control of the network.
------
Completing a region activates its real-time alerts. This is key to attacking high-value targets.
------
You begin at Mercury's Terminus, your only way into the system. It is time for the Tenno to return.
------
A lone Tenno operative is raiding this ship for supplies, you are here to distract the enemy. Trigger the alarms.
------
Your job is to distract the enemy while a fellow Tenno operative raids the ship for much needed supplies. Make your presence known.
------
Keep the enemy busy while a Tenno operative raids this ship for supplies. Ready? Trigger the alarms.
------
Life support has been cut off. They're trying to choke you out. Hold on, I'm sending auxiliary life support.
------
They've turned off critical life support systems. I suspected they might try this, stand by for support.
------
They have just shut down all systems. I'm sending life support capsules your way.
------
The first life support capsule has arrived. Activate it when your supply is low.
------
I've delivered a life support capsule to the area. Activating it will buy you more time.
------
Activate the life support capsule to keep fighting.
------
Life support incoming.
------
Tenno, prepare for life support
------
Life support on the way.
------
Get ready for a capsule.
------
Additional life support has arrived.
------
Another life support capsule is now available.
------
I've delivered another life support capsule.
------
Life support activated.
------
That should keep you going for a while.
------
Life support has been replenished.
------
Fallen enemies will drop crucial life support, be on the lookout.
------
Look for personal life support modules dropped by fallen enemies. 
------
The raid is off to a successful start.
------
The operative has just made their first discovery. Keep up the good work.
------
Our operative is making progress. This will help our cause.
------
Look what our Tenno operative just found. They could not do this without you.
------
We will all share in this bounty. Hold out as long as you can.
------
The longer you fight, the more successful we will be.
------
Things are getting tight. Sixty seconds of life support remaining.
------
Be aware you are down to your last sixty seconds of life support.
------
Only sixty seconds left. 
------
Thirty seconds left.
------
You are running out of time.
------
Thirty second warning.
------
Extraction is available, if you need it.
------
When you are ready, go to extraction
------
When you need it, extraction is ready.
------
Critical life support levels. Extraction is your best option.
------
You are running out of time. Consider extraction.
------
Tenno, extraction is ready.
------
Your are here to find our target and bring them to the extraction point. Happy hunting.
------
We received intel that somebody vital to enemy operations is here. Find them, and capture them.
------
You are here on a Capture mission. You must find, capture and extract our target.
------
We have multiple targets of interest for this mission. Bring them all to me.
------
Capture all targets on this ship. Bring them to me alive.
------
The capture target has vital information that we will need to extract, we need our subject brought back alive.
------
We cannot let our target know we're here. Track them down quickly.
------
Scans indicate our target is in the vicinity. Find them.
------
These are high value targets, their capture is crucial.
------
Be aware Tenno, these targets are a very high flight risk.
------
You found the capture target. Do not let them escape.
------
There's our target. Capture and extract them.
------
Our subject is here. Capture them and do not let them escape.
------
You've found a target. Capture them quickly before they escape.
------
Target located, bring them in.
------
Success! The captive is safely in our hands. Congratulations Tenno.
------
Mission complete, the captive has been escorted to the extraction point. Well done.
------
Excellent work. We'll interrogate the captive back at base. Your part is done here, Tenno.
------
Target captured. On to the next.
------
Target apprehended. Keep hunting.
------
Mission failed. The target has escaped.
------
They've got away. We have failed.
------
You failed Tenno, your captive has escaped.
------
All targets have escaped. This is most disappointing.
------
They all got away, this mission is a failure.
------
We lost that one. Do not let any more get away.
------
Target escaped. Do not let that happen again.
------
This is a rescue mission. We need to find and liberate the hostage before any harm comes to them.
------
Here are the holding cells. Search each one for the hostage. 
------
An Operative from the Red Veil is being held hostage somewhere in this facility. Find the hostage and bring them home.
------
There is a prisoner here that is vital to our operations. Search for the holding location.
------
The captive will be in one of these cells. Search them.
------
Our intel suggests that our person of interest is in the vicinity. Search for the hostage, and bring them home.
------
We've reached the prison. Find our prisoner in one of these cells. 
------
This is the jail. Our hostage is in one of these cells.
------
Find the captive as soon as you can, we don't have much time.
------
We can't leave without rescuing the prisoner, keep searching.
------
There's no telling what the captors are doing to our rescue target, you need to find the holding cell immediately.
------
The Red Veil is a newly formed resistance movement that has quickly gained traction across the system. We need to support them as much as we can.
------
Our enemies think they can force the Red Veil into submission by holding their members hostage. You're here to stop this from happening.
------
Popular resistance to Grineer and Corpus domination has been rare and fleeting. If we don't support their cause the Red Veil will surely fade into oblivion.
------
You've located the hostage. Escort the prisoner to the extraction point and I'll take care of the rest.
------
Subject found. You need to bring the captive to safety. Protect them at all costs.
------
Prisoner located. We need to get them back to command in one piece, find your way to the exits and don't leave the subject behind.
------
Mission complete. The captive has been liberated, you will be rewarded for this Tenno.
------
Escort mission complete, the hostage is safe now. Let's get out of here.
------
The captive has been secured, you've done your part Tenno, we'll take it from here.
------
I thought I was going to die in there. Thank you.
------
Thank you Tenno.
------
I am in your debt Tenno. Lets go home.
------
I can fight too, if you give me a weapon.
------
Give me a weapon and I'll watch your back. 
------
Got an extra weapon? They won't just let us walk out of here. 
------
I'm down.
------
Ahh... bleeding out.
------
They got me, Tenno help.
------
Hurry up, I'm running out of time.
------
In here. I'M IN HERE!
------
Tenno, in here!
------
[Mission Failed Death rattle]
------
[Mission Failed Death rattle]
------
[Death rattle]
------
[Death rattle]
------
We need to take full control here. Get to the rally point and defend it from enemy attackers.
------
We can't afford to lose this location. We must reach the rally point and resist all opposing forces.
------
The artifact we need is nearby, but it can't be extracted by regular means. We need to take full command here and defend the location against all attackers until an extraction crew can arrive.
------
You are almost at the rally point, keep moving.
------
We can't let the artifact fall into enemy hands, get to it and defend it at all costs.
------
I'm detecting a high amount of activity at the rally point, you need to get there pronto.
------
Okay, we're here. Take up defensive positions, we're expecting company.
------
This appears to be the primary zone of contention. Brace yourself for attack.
------
Looks like we beat them here, take up a defensive position and be ready for enemy assault teams.
------
That's the last of them, objective is secure. Lets go home.
------
Very impressive Tenno, you held them all back. Time to get out of here.
------
We're done here. The extraction team will take over from here, time to evacuate.
------
The intelligence files we need are in the area. Find all four computer access terminals and recover the data units from each of them.
------
Intelligence files are stored on four separate data units in the vicinity.  We need all the units before we can begin decryption on the data. Get out there and find them.
------
We need all of the data units being stored in the vicinity. Search the area, find the access terminals, and retrieve each device.
------
Your target is this location's computer system. Find and access the terminals.
------
There must be an access terminal around here, keep searching, we need those data units.
------
Its critical that we retrieve that intel. You need to find an access terminal first.
------
We're running out of time, you need to find all the remaining access terminal and get out of there.
------
Keep going, we need all of the data units before you can leave.
------
We don't have all of the logs yet, keep searching for the remaining consoles.
------
Here is one of the access consoles, you need to activate it to recover the data unit.
------
You found an access terminal, use it to release the data mass from its storage unit. 
------
Activate the access terminal and it should release the data unit. Get the device, and get to extraction.
------
Excellent work Tenno, we've got all the data units now. Time to head for the exits.
------
That was the last data unit we needed. Lets get out of here.
------
With all four data units collected we can now compile the intelligence files. We're done here, get to extraction.
------
This looks ominous. Infested or not, we need those data logs. See if you can find any consoles that are still operational.
------
We need all the data logs from any still-functioning consoles aboard this ship. Shouldn't be a problem for you unless the Infested slow you down.
------
The Assassination target is nearby.  Seek and destroy.
------
We need to find the VIP and take them down. Do not let the target escape.
------
The VIP that we're hunting is here, find them and take them out.
------
Assassination contracts are not to be taken lightly. Eliminating this target will have a significant impact on enemy forces. Search the area, leave no survivors.
------
We've contracted you with a mark. You are here to find your mark, and eliminate the assigned target. 
------
Keep searching, the VIP is here somewhere.
------
We need to find and eliminate the target.
------
We can't let the target escape, you need to find them immediately.
------
This mission won't be easy, the target you are to assassinate has survived these attacks before. Be careful.
------
Target spotted. Stay sharp, this one is a handful.
------
There is the assassination target, you know what to do.
------
You've located the VIP, time to go to work.
------
Target acquired, take them down.
------
The assassination target is here. Wipe them out.
------
They won't be bothering us anymore, let's get out of here.
------
Nice work taking down the VIP, now get to extraction.
------
Target down, assassination contract complete. Great work Tenno.
------
This is a sabotage mission. Reach engineering and destroy the reactor.
------
Our target is the reactor. Breach engineering and destroy it. Be careful.
------
Your target is the reactor.
------
We need to destroy the reactor.
------
Disabling the reactor core will cripple the enemy. Find it, and take it out.
------
The reactor will have tight security. Watch out for enemy patrols.
------
Target found, destroy it.
------
That's the reactor, expose its core and destroy it.
------
Target destroyed, proceed to the extraction point.
------
That's it, now get out of here.
------
Your target is the system mainframe. Deliver the payload.
------
Okay, you're looking for the mainframe. It's critical that you deliver the payload to that location.
------
The mainframe is around here somewhere. Keep searching for it.
------
You're almost at the target, keep it up.
------
You've found the target. Deliver the payload and get out of there.
------
Payload delivery successfully, time to go.
------
Your objective is near, keep pushing forward.
------
Nice work, you're almost at the objective.
------
You're closing in on the target, keep your eyes peeled.
------
You're nearing the target, stay on guard.
------
There's the artifact, collect what we need and head to extraction.
------
Artifact found, acquire the Orokin technology and head to the rally point.
------
I'm detecting infested bio signatures all over the place. You know what to do.
------
The infestation has corrupted all life here, let's clear it out.
------
We have got an infestation. Extermination is the only option.
------
Eliminate all Corpus threats.
------
There is a large platoon of Grineer Marines stationed here. Leave no one standing.
------
We need to clean this vessel up, search for the source of the infestation and exterminate it.
------
The area is crawling with infested. If its not a Tenno, eradicate it.
------
I'm still detecting a lot of infestation activity, let's clean it up.
------
No further life forms detected.
------
Other than you, I can't detect a single life form. Let's get out of here.
------
This is a mobile defense mission. You must deliver payloads and defend a number of locations while I break into the network. Be prepared for heavy resistance. I can't do this without you. 
------
This will only get more difficult. Get to a terminal and prepare for enemy resistance. 
------
We have got to find a terminal. Proceed and prepare!
------
I need access to a terminal, find one and patch me in! 
------
Location reached: Drop me in and defend our position!
------
Terminal Spotted: Upload me in and prepare to defend!
------
Here is a terminal: Get me in, and get ready to defend! 
------
I'm in, Tenno. This will take a moment.
------
Still working on it, continue to defend!
------
Hack complete. Keep moving.
------
Area completed. Move on!
------
Terminal Hacked. Keep moving!
------
We're finished here, move on!
------
All Terminals have been successfully hacked. Excellent resistance, Tenno. Let's make our exit!
------
The odds were against us, Tenno - but we did it. Mission complete.
------
All data logs indicate that there is an Orokin Artifact somewhere here, get to it now, defend it, and then we can leave!
------
Artifact found. Defend it until the Extraction Team arrives.
------
Mission complete. Excellent work Tenno.
------
Great work. I am pleased with your performance.
------
Another job well executed.
------
We are here to hijack the transport of a Fomorian Power core before it can be installed in the growing Fomorian fleet. 
------
A Fomorian Core is being transported from the factory for installation. You are here to make sure that core never reaches a Fomorian class ship.
------
We need to take these cores into deep space for destruction. A core rupture here would turn this outpost into an uninhabitable wasteland.
------
Left unchecked, Project Tethra will create hundreds of new Fomorian class ships. We plan to stop as many ships being built as possible by destroying their most critical components, the Fomorian Core.
------
The Grineer are transporting the core by cargo tram. Find the control console to reroute the tram.
------
Good, the tram has been rerouted. It will now draw power from your shields in order to keep moving forward.
------
Excellent. We now have control of the tram. It's drive systems have been overridden and it will now draw power from you shields.
------
You have reached the console. Hack into the system and reroute the core.
------
Stay near the tram to power it forward. Beware, that power is being drawn directly from your shields.
------
Stay close to the tram. It has been reconfigured to draw power from your shields in order to move you forward.
------
Something has happened, the core is becoming unstable. We must get it out of here before it ruptures. Any additional damage will only hasten its destruction.
------
I am detecting instability in the core. A rupture is inevitable, get the core out of there as fast as possible.
------
The core cannot move forward without your shields to power it. Stay near the core.
------
A Tenno must be near the core for it to move forward.
------
Stay near the core to keep it moving forward.
------
Grineer have regained control of the tram. 
------
The Grineer have control and are pulling back the tram. 
------
The tram is retreating. 
------
Get these doors open if you want to keep the core moving.
------
The tram is not going anywhere until you get these doors open.
------
They are trying to lock you in. Get the bay doors open.
------
Careful, the tram has drawn too much power and is about to discharge.
------
Stand back Tenno, the tram is about to discharge excess power.
------
Watch out for mines on the track. The enemy will use everything they can to stop us.
------
Be careful, my scans show this track has been mined.
------
The track has been mined, proceed with caution.
------
We are making progress. Stay sharp Tenno.
------
So far so good. Keep moving the tram toward extraction.
------
You have reached the midpoint. Disposing of these cores will be a massive blow to Vay Hek.
------
You are making solid progress. Keep moving.
------
You are nearing extraction. This is the final push.
------
Extraction is close. Do not let up. The Grineer must not be allowed to recover this core.
------
The core is highly volatile. It will rupture if it takes too much damage. Do not let this happen.
------
Protect the core. We will destroy it in space. The consequences of a rupture here are unthinkable.
------
That core is taking heavy damage. If it ruptures, the ground you stand on will be uninhabitable for millennia.
------
Protect the core from enemy fire. A rupture means certain death.
------
The situation is desperate, if that core takes much more damage it could wipe out you and this entire outpost.
------
The core has almost ruptured. The situation is critical!
------
The core is rupturing. I am sorry Tenno, there is nothing I can do for you.
------
A rupture is imminent. Tenno, you must prepare yourself for what comes next.
------
The core has reached extraction. This is a major setback for Project Tethra.
------
We have the core. The Grineer will not be pleased with our victory.
------
Upload completed. Nice work. Get to extraction.
------
Tenno? Can you hear me? You've been a naughty little betrayer, haven't you? Did you really think your support for the Grineer would go unnoticed? 
------
That is just the sort of behavior I just can't let go uncorrected. Otherwise, you'll never learn.
------
This is really for your own good, Tenno. Help me, help you... help me. 
------
Good job Zanuka. This Tenno's bones will make you a fine sibling.
------
Zanuka? No! What have you monsters done to my beautiful creature? I won't forget this.
------
Tenno. Tenno can you hear me? You've been captured by Alad V's harvester. This is your chance, escape.
------
Tenno. Ready yourself. You have been captured by the Corpus. It is time to escape.
------
Leaving so soon? We were just getting started.
------
Oh, Tenno. I understand you're nervous. But if you come back to us I can assure you; you won't feel a thing.
------
Tenno, don't listen to that... that Lotus. She just wants to hold you back. Stay with me explore your...potential.
------
Tenno, Tenno! There's an entire Grineer battalion here to rescue you. Your friends must really appreciate your support. Wait, no. I'm mistaken. Your alone, with no weapons and no friends. Silly me. 
------
The Grineer are a threat to us all. You need to understand the error of you ways. Consider my efforts a favor... yes.
------
I have extraction ready but you have to find your weapons first. Can you handle that?
------
You're not going to last long without your weapons, they are scattered around this facility. Find them.
------
You found your powers.
------
You found your primary weapon. Lock and load.
------
Sidearm located. Keep moving.
------
That's your melee weapon.
------
You found all your weapons. Get out of there.
------
You're done. Extraction is waiting. Go.
------
You have chosen to support the Grineer in this fight. Eliminate all Corpus.
------
You are fighting alongside the Grineer on this mission. Destroy all Corpus. 
------
Make sure the Grineer win this battle, leave no Corpus functioning.
------
Rraahudd Tenno! Now we fight together! Now we crush the greedy milk from their skulls. The Corpus will pay for their crimes with their useless lives.
------
You shoot well. You cut well. You serve me well, Tenno.
------
Tenno, of course you side with us. Of course the Grineer are your best option. We share your joy in Corpus death.
------
What's that test tube dog giving you to fight for him? Whatever it is I'll double it!
------
So, the betrayers are fighting for the dogs now? Why am I not surprised. The sooner my Zanuka project is completed the better. The system must be ridden of your hypocrisy.
------
Do you really think you are saving your comrades by supporting the dogs. What do you think happens if you allow Sargas to win? Do you think they'll be safe when you're all his slaves?
------
Why Tenno what an intriguing Warframe you have. I look forward to adding it to my inventory.
------
The Corpus have been eliminated. Time to head home.
------
That's it, I am detecting no functioning Corpus. Get to extraction.
------
The situation forces you to help The Corpus in this mission. Kill all Grineer.
------
Your sense of duty compels you to help The Corpus today. Destroy all Grineer forces to help maintain the balance.
------
You are fighting with The Corpus in this battle. No Grineer can be left alive.
------
So we agree. The Grineer are too powerful, too arrogant. They must be put in their place. I'm glad you won't let our differences get in the way of our common interests.
------
Tenno, you know, we may not always see eye to eye... well, you don't have eyes but I'm pleased we've found common ground in our fight with these Grineer dogs.
------
You've made a smart choice Tenno. When the Dogs fall there will be profit for all of us.
------
Tenno, this was the only rational choice. And please don't worry about your friends, I have grand plans for them.
------
You and I aren't so different Tenno. We both know those dogs need to be put down. I sense we are at the beginning of a beautiful new partnership.
------
Nobody wants to be a slave. You understand that. These dogs aren't our masters, we won't follow their orders any longer.
------
Rraahudd Tenno! So willing to sacrifice your own. So willing to help these greedy worms. So willing to die for worthless cause.
------
Tenno, Alad will betray you. Alad will defile your kind. Alad will bleed from his selfish eyes as I crush him with your metal corpse.
------
Attention Tenno: Is it too late to change sides? Too late to reject the Corpus lies? Too late to save your kind?
------
That was the last Grineer. Get out of there.
------
All the Grineer are dead. Proceed to extraction.
------
Wipe out this infestation. 
------
Nobody deserves the infestation. Clear it from this node.
------
Eliminate all infested threats.
------
We must destroy this infestation before the monsters become entrenched.
------
Containment has become impossible, we must destroy this infestation node by node.
------
The infestation is a threat to all life, we have to wipe it out, even if it means working with the other factions.
------
Being turned by the infested is a fate worse than death. Even our enemies don't deserve this.
------
The infestation cannot be allowed to spread.
------
I'm detecting no traces of the disease. Get out of there.
------
We're done. Let's get out of there.
------
Picking sides is never easy. You are doing what you feel is right.
------
Supporting the enemy feels wrong, but keeping the balance requires tough choices. 
------
This aggression has upset the balance of power. We must set things right.
------
It is doubtful that we can trust any Corpus but helping Frohd Bek is the only way we can get to Alad V. Remove the infestation from this ship.
------
This infestation stands between us and Alad V. Clear this ship.
------
 I don't trust Frohd Bek but I trust his hatred for Alad V. We'll help him now, if it means we can stop the Zanuka project.
------
One more Infested ship cleared. Get out of there.
------
I'm not detecting any more Infested. We're making progress. Get to extraction.
------
Oh Alad, all your lying and sneaking and cheating, and what do you have to show for it? You're in dept to the board and I've come to collect.
------
Look at you Alad, hiding in a corner, playing with your toys. How embarrassing. The Corpus deserves better and I'm the one to deliver the goods.
------
What happened to you Alad? I looked up to you. Your profits. Your products. A little madness and you throw it all to the Void.
------
You can't hide, ride or bribe your way out of this Alad. You've been downsized and your fat head is about to suffer cutbacks. Literal cutbacks.
------
Who got you fired? Who got Zanuka's funding pulled? Oh I know this! I know this! It was me.
------
I'm feeling a promotion coming my way! About to climb another rung on this ladder! About to send my old pal Alad V into early retirement.
------
Hey Alad. Zanuka is done! You are done! When you're dead the Board will be signing over everything you own to me!
------
The Tenno are too dangerous, too profitable, to provoke! Zanuka was a bad paradigm. A costly miscalculation but don't worry Alad, I'll keep your credits warm when you're gone.
------
It's time for your to pay your debts! I've got the Betrayers doing the repro work - if you ask me they've got a different idea of blood money.
------
These Corpus scouts think they are safely hiding in the void, that is a false assumption. Bring them to me. 
------
You are looking for a Corpus scouts, they have crucial information about the location of those Grineer settlements.
------
Somewhere in this void ship are Corpus scouts, they have crucial information about the location of the Grineer settlements.
------
This is your most dangerous assassination yet - Captain Vor has teamed up with Lech Kril to take you down. Let's show them your true Tenno power.
------
Vor and Kril are waiting for you. I recommend you focus your attacks on one target, if you split your attention you may fail.
------
Vor's mobility could make him the larger threat. Observe their attack patterns and look for an opportunity to divide and conquer.
------
We cannot allow the scouts to escape.
------
Keep moving, the sooner we find the scouts, the sooner we can decode the location of those settlements.
------
We must not let the targets slip through our fingers. Find the scouts.
------
You found a scout. Execute the capture protocols.
------
Good job finding a target. Make sure he doesn't get away.
------
Our subject is here. Capture the scout.
------
You captured a scout but your job isn't done yet. There are still more.
------
You got him. Keep going.
------
Target apprehended. Find the others.
------
That's the last scout.  Head to extraction.
------
I am not detecting any more scouts. Get to extraction.
------
We are one step closer to finding those settlements. Time to head home.
------
That scout got away but there are still more. Keep moving.
------
We lost him. Find the others.
------
Target lost. Locate one of the others.
------
Mission failed. All the scouts escaped
------
You let all the scouts escape.
------
The scouts escaped! We are no closer to finding those settlements. This is most disappointing Tenno.
------
Keep the enemy distracted while our operative conducts a supply raid. Trigger the alarms when you are ready to start.
------
You are supporting a lone Tenno operative today. Distract the enemy. Trigger the alarms.
------
On the other side of this facility a lone Tenno is conducting a supply raid. Keep the enemy distracted. Let them know you are here.
------
This generator core on this outpost must be destroyed.
------
Keep moving. The power source is deep within the outpost.
------
The power core has been destroyed.
------
Find all the data units on this outpost. Valuable intel lies within.
------
There is still more data.
------
All data units located. Let's get out of here.
------
Sensors show this outpost is crawling with Infested. Exterminate the threat.
------
I'm still picking up signs of the Infested. Keep hunting.
------
The outpost is clean. Proceed to extraction.
------
There are Corpus everywhere. You need to take them out.
------
We cannot allow the Corpus to control this outpost. Keep fighting.
------
All Corpus threats have been eliminated. Time to come home.
------
We need to send a message to the Grineer. Eliminate everyone on this base.
------
The Grineer presence is still strong. There is more work to be done.
------
You are done. It is time for extraction.
------
Your target is deep within this outpost. Find and eliminate him.
------
Target eliminated. Get out of here.
------
You've found the target. Destroy them.
------
Our position has been compromised. Defend the cargo until reinforcements arrive.
------
The enemy is at our doorstep. You must defend our equipment until reinforcements arrive.
------
Another assault wave approaches.
------
Ready yourselves. 
------
It's not over yet.
------
Their reinforcements are endless! Are you ready for more?
------
Incoming targets. You know what to do.
------
Reinforcements are inbound. Hold the line.
------
We are readying reinforcements. Keep fighting Tenno.
------
Reinforcements available, do you choose to leave now or continue fighting?
------
Extraction is ready. Unless you can handle more of the enemy.
------
Rest now, others will continue the battle.
------
Go now Tenno. You have done well.
------
Continue to defend! You will be rewarded for your bravery.
------
Keep fighting. Another opportunity to extract will appear soon.
------
The Grineer have been harvesting a nearby planetoid for weapons-grade material. Locate and destroy their mining equipment.
------
Destroying a single reactor will not be enough to take down a Fomorian. We will need to poison the well... coordinated teams will corrupt it's fuel supply. This will require gear harvested from Infestation tissues. I will route you to an injector point...
------
These Fomorians are massive, keep searching. You will need to locate a fuel cell and inject the corrupting agent. I hope you have a corruptor with you.
------
Remember, if you are coordinating with other Tenno the Alpha/Beta mixtures are more potent, but a single Tenno cannot equip them at once.
------
There it is! You should be able to inject the corruptor you brought using the attached console. 
------
Excellent, the corruption process has begun. You must defend this position to ensure the Grineer do not destroy this fuel cell before it spreads through the ship.
------
Corruption process is complete. Good work Tenno. Get to extraction where I will record your contribution to the operation!
------
The mining equipment is nearby. It must be destroyed to prevent the Grineer from developing energy weapons.
------
This research could have unimaginable repercussions. Be on your guard.
------
Mission success hinges on the destruction of the mining equipment. Expect heavy resistance.
------
The Grineer are preparing to magnetically mine asteroids for rare alloys to be used in body augmentations and modifications. Paralyze their research by destroying the mining equipment.
------
A heavily armed security force stands between you and the mining equipment. Stay alert.
------
Crippling their equipment will effectively cripple their research.
------
We need you back alive. Stay alert.
------
You are gaining the upper hand. Push forward.
------
They are aware of your presence. Make haste.
------
Well done. You have brought the Grineer research to a sudden halt.
------
A dormant comet is being targeted by the Grineer for its volatile materials. The material will be used in the manufacturing of fuel propellant for their fleet. Locate and cripple their equipment.
------
Destroy the mining equipment before the Grineer can intercept the comet.
------
It is time to bring the Grineer fleet to a standstill. Strike them where it hurts.
------
Halting fuel production will give us a much needed advantage. Determine the position of the equipment.
------
Hostiles inbound. Strike hard and fast.
------
Impressive. This will temporarily immobilize the Grineer fleet. We will move-in and claim the comet.
------
The Grineer have set their sights on a large asteroid thought to contain an abundance of Rubedo. Locate and destroy the extraction equipment.
------
Rubedo must be protected at any cost. Sabotage the nearby mining equipment.
------
It is imperative we do not let the Grineer get their hands on the Rubedo. 
------
You are approaching a piece of equipment. Watch your back.
------
Good work. Your efforts have prevented Grineer access to the Rubedo. We have an extraction team en route to appropriate the planetoid's contents.
------
We've received a message that we are to eliminate a target at this location. Carry out the assassination.
------
Well, this just got interesting. We now need to capture a target here.
------
It seems we'll be here a little longer. Deposit a data unit into the location's mainframe
------
We've received a second objective. Defend the artifact in this location before it's destroyed.
------
Change of plans, ignore your original objective. Leave nothing alive.
------
It appears there's some valuable intel stored here. Gather the intel now.
------
I can't breach this door's security. We'll have to find a key pass. Scanning the ship now... Key signal detected. Marking on your HUD.
------
We're locked out, patching us in now. I can't bypass this door. Scanning ship now for key pass... Found it. Marking location on your HUD.
------
Our mission just got more complicated. There's a hostage here. Rescue them now.
------
Well, what do you know. I'm detecting an Orokin Artifact here. Extract it before we leave.
------
It appears we now need to sabotage this location. Destroy the Reactor Core.
------
Orokin towers have the power to assume physical control of intruders. Your Warframe should protect you from the tower, of course you will still be vulnerable to those under it's control.
------
This Orokin tower has been hidden within The Void for over two hundred years. Be careful, we have no idea what or who we might find.
------
You have entered the The Void. Use caution Tenno, Orokin Towers have a special way of dealing with unwanted visitors.
------
Congratulations Tenno, you are now inside The Void. This tower may be centuries old but it's Neural Sentry is still operational, stay alert.
------
Careful, Orokin towers are often guarded by a Neural Sentry, a dangerous entity capable of corrupting intruders and assuming control of their bodies.
------
You aren't the first ones here. I'm detecting multiple enemy signatures and they're all under the control of the tower. Eliminate the threat.
------
The tower's Neural Sentry is operational. I'm picking up multiple threats all under Orokin control. Wipe them all out.
------
You are not alone. This tower is full of life forms, all corrupted by the Neural Sentry. Clean them out.
------
Keep fighting. As long as the enemy is here, this tower is useless to us. 
------
The tower's Neural Sentry has turned these soldiers into mindless attack drones. You need to take them out.
------
The Grineer should have known better than to walk into an Orokin Tower unprepared. Let's clean up their mess.
------
This tower is clean, we can take it from here. Get to extraction.
------
That was the final enemy. The tower has nothing left to defend itself with. Proceed to extraction.
------
You've eliminated all Orokin controlled enemies. Time to go home.
------
This tower holds powerful knowledge from the Orokin age. I need you to locate the artifact stored here.
------
Somewhere in this tower is Orokin technology so valuable, they hid it in The Void. I need you to find that technology.
------
These Grineer were likely looking for the same thing we are. Unfortunately, they came ill-prepared for the tower's defense network.
------
You are nearing the artifact. Expect heavy resistance.
------
The tower has corrupted every intruder that came before you. Keep fighting, the artifact is near.
------
You are nearing the target.
------
There it is. Obtain the artifact.
------
Artifact found, acquire the Orokin technology and head to the rally point.
------
We have what we came for, get to extraction.
------
Artifact acquired. Make your way to the extraction point.
------
We have traced every infestation attack in the Jupiter sector back to this location. You are here to stop those attacks at their source.
------
A creature classified as the J3-Golem has made this base its den. Find the Golem and destroy it. 
------
The creature has mutated beyond the strength of a typical infested. Do not let your guard down.
------
It was difficult to locate the source vector of this sector's infestation but you are finally here.
------
Deep within this  millennia old Orokin-turned-Infested ship lurks a creature created to fight in the Old War. Make your way to its location and dispatch this monster.
------
Be wary. The creature has grown unfathomably strong through centuries of absorbing matter and self-replication.
------
Alad V's newest prototype is a monstrosity forged from the bodies of our fallen Tenno, we cannot allow Zanuka to go into full production. Destroy Alad V and his horrid 'pet'.
------
Too many Tenno have perished to make Alad V's abomination. There will be no stopping the Corpus if Zanuka is mass produced. You are here to make sure that doesn't happen.
------
The Zanuka prototype has made Alad V a very dangerous man. If he is allowed to carry out his plans, no Tenno in this system will be safe. 
------
Be careful Tenno, Zanuka has all the power of a Warframe with a full complement of mods. It's as if you are fighting one of your own today.
------
Alad V sees the power of the Tenno and thinks he can take it for himself. That power is sacred, this blasphemy must end now.
------
If Alad V is victorious today he will dissect your Warframe and use the pieces to build more of his 'pets'. You must not let this happen.
------
I am detecting a Prosecutor. Get ready for a tough fight.
------
Tenno. Get ready. A Prosecutor is approaching.
------
Use caution. I am picking up traces of Prosecutor shield auras in your vicinity. 
------
That Prosecutor shield aura has to be vulnerable to something. You need to figure out what that is.
------
The aura from these Prosecutors is blocking most damage types. Throw everything you've got at him, something has to get through.
------
The Prosecutors vulnerabilities appear variable, your squad will need to come to battle ready to break any type of defense.
------
My scans show that the Prosecutor shield aura may be vulnerable to some elemental damage but I am having difficulty discerning specifics.
------
Prosecutor down. Stay alert, there could be more ahead.
------
Good work. You have proven the Prosecutors are not invincible.
------
Prosecutor eliminated. Watch out for more.
------
Attack!
------
Attack!
------
Stay close to cover
------
Try and get behind it, we'll flank it out.
------
Don't let them get away!
------
Lock this area down.
------
Secure the perimeter!
------
Track down the intruder.
------
Spread out, find them!
------
Fan out!
------
Get them!
------
Stay on guard.
------
Destroy all Tenno!
------
Hold your position!
------
Hold them back!
------
Cover me!
------
Get me some suppressing fire.
------
Suppressing fire!
------
Watch my back!
------
Taking point, cover me.
------
Covering fire!
------
Cover me, I'm going in.
------
I need covering fire.
------
I'm bored out of my mind.
------
Hey, leave my mother out of this.
------
You guys see anything suspicious?
------
No activity to report.
------
Ok... ok, I'll check.
------
Just once I wish it would get exciting around here.
------
All clear in this sector.
------
Its too quiet in here.
------
How did I get stuck with this post? Security against what?
------
Am I seeing things?
------
Huh? Thought I heard something.
------

Is that suit a giant diaper?
------
Orokin secrets can't remain safe forever.
------
From pods you come, in caskets you will go.
------
I never expected your loyalty, you've always been a betrayer to me.
------
Now you come to save your friends? After fighting for me. After taking my rewards.  Where are your business ethics Tenno?
------
What is this? We're partners! I'm starting to think I was wrong about being wrong about you. Betrayer.
------
When I am the market leader you fight for me but you turn when the competition gets tough. What fickle things you Tenno are.
------
Now, let me show you the future... Zanuka Kill
------
We worked so well together Tenno. Now you want to go and throw all that profit away. That makes me sad. 
------
Tenno, you could be so much greater than the sum of all the different parts I will tear you into.
------
You have a loyalty issue Tenno. My Zanuka project will fix that for you.
------
I've been looking all over for you Tenno. Come, let me show you my new venture. I think you'd be a perfect fit.
------
Have you come to make a donation to my newest enterprise? Excellent. Please report to my lab for reconstruction.
------
If it's your friends you are looking for, you're welcome to place a bid for my newest Zanuka prototype.
------
I can't decide Tenno, have you come to save your friends? Or just steal my property?
------
Tenno, Project Zanuka is the next step in your evolution. I will make you a hundred times stronger. Why resist this?
------
Market forces dictate that you need to evolve or die. Which will it be Tenno?
------
Tenno be careful. You must make sure not to damage all those parts of yours. Such valuable merchandise.
------
Play nice Tenno, Zanuka is one of you. Actually, come to think of it, Zanuka is many of you.
------
Zanuka is your future. Your destiny. You are obsolete, make way for the next generation.
------
Zanuka. Tear them apart.
------
Ungrateful. You'll never know what I could have done for you.
------
Do you think this is over?
------
You build nothing. All you do is destroy.
------
Barrier!
------
Barrier Up!
------
Good girl, Zanuka.
------
Thank you, Zanuka.
------
Zanuka! Do not touch her.
------
No. Leave her alone!
------
ARGGh... Zanuka!
------
Thousand suns!
------
Blinding beam!
------
You have entered my domain. Uninvited and unprepared for my judgment. I will make you humble.
------
Your future was bright Tenno. And now you throw that way.
------
Treason gets quick punishment in my court. Have you come to receive justice? 
------
Kneel before your master. Pray to me, like I am a god. That is the only reason you should be here.
------
Regret... will be your legacy.
------
Treason? After you pledge yourself to me. Is you honor so hollow? 
------
This betrayal, I was expecting. Tenno have no loyalty to their masters.
------
You are useless. A ricochet. Your treachery is impotent.
------
Your hollow corpse will be paraded around the empire. A warning to future rats.
------
What flesh is within that Warframe? I will crush it. I will fill my lungs with your death.
------
Forget The Lotus. Grineer are your masters. Submit for mercy.
------
Too easy. I expected more. I deserve a challenge.
------
Are you just mercenaries? Fighting for scraps? Where is this so-called Tenno honor?
------
You think you are guardians? Grineer rule supreme. Grineer protect all.
------
You Tenno. You fight for treasure. You are just another Corpus machine to me.
------
This is not over. 
------
We are just getting started.
------
You fight well. Your death will be glorious.

Oh hello Tenno... why the long face? Worried about your friends? Hmm... it is true that they were unwilling, but rest assured, participation in the Zanuka project is a very prestigious honor. 

------
Are you sure you can't just let this go? We would make great partners you know. Produce great profits. Hmm... not interested? That's too bad. For you.
------
Tenno, look. I believe so strongly in my Zanuka prototype that I'm willing to give you a demo. It will be quite the opportunity, most people don't get to see the future... before they die.

WARFRAMES
------
Warframe exo-armor uses unique combative technology to create the ultimate weaponry. The Warframes hold many mysterious powers and mastering one requires dedicated use.
------
TRINITY
------
Trinity is great for players who prefer a supportive role. Warframes with healing technologies are rare making Trinity a great equalizer when the odds are stacked against the Tenno.
------
VOLT
------
Volt can create and harness electrical elements. This is a high-damage Warframe perfect for players who want a potent alternative to gun-play.
------
ASH
------
Ash is great for players looking for a stealthier approach to combat. Lethal abilities are complemented by powers of distraction.
------
NYX
------
Mind control and psychic attacks make Nyx a very dangerous foe. Her ability to reach into enemy consciousness and manipulate their behavior can turn the tide of any battle.
------
EMBER
------
Ember is a nightmare for light-armored targets. Ember can super-heat the air, which opens up surprising crowd-control possibilities.
------
FROST
------
By channeling moisture and vapor in the surrounding environment, Frost creates formidable defenses and lethal attacks from sub-zero conditions.
------
EXCALIBUR
------
The perfect training Warframe: the Excalibur suit allows players to explore the power of Warframes with a balanced set of capabilities.
------
MAG
------
With full command of surrounding magnetic energy, Mag is an expert at enemy manipulation. She is a perfect choice for players that want to deal heavy damage in unconventional ways.
